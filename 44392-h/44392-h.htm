<h2><a name="FURNITURE" id="FURNITURE">FURNITURE</a></h2>

<p>Whether the primitive Iberians ate as well as
slept upon their cave or cabin floor, or whether&mdash;as
some classics call upon us to believe&mdash;they used
a kind of folding-chair (<i>dureta</i>) and (more advanced
and comfort-loving than the Andalusian rustics of
this day) devoured their simple meal from benches
or supports constructed in the wall, is not of
paramount importance to the history of Spanish
furniture. The statements of those early authors
may be granted or rejected as we please; for not
a single piece of furniture produced by prehistoric,
or, indeed, by Roman or by Visigothic Spain, has
been preserved. But if we look for evidence to
other crafts, recovered specimens of her early gold
and silver work and pottery show us that Roman
Spain grew to be eminently Roman in her social
and artistic life. This fact, together with the statements
of Saint Isidore and certain other writers of
his day, would seem to prove that all the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
articles of Roman furniture were commonly adopted
by the subjugated tribes, and subsequently by the
Visigoths;&mdash;the Roman eating-couch or <i>lectus
triclinaris</i>, the state-bed or <i>lectus genialis</i>, the
ordinary sleeping-bed or <i>lectus cubicularis</i>, made,
in prosperous households, of luxurious woods
inlaid with ivory, or even of gold and silver;
lamps or candelabra of silver, copper, glass,
and iron<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; the <i>cathedra</i> or chair for women,
the <i>bisellium</i> or seat for honoured guests, the
<i>solium</i> or chair for the head of the house, the
simpler chairs without a back, known as the
<i>scabellum</i> and the <i>sella</i>, and the benches or
<i>subsellia</i> for the servants. Further, the walls
were hung with tapestries or rendered cheerful
by mural painting; while the fireplace<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
the brasier (<i>foculus</i>) have descended to contemporary
Spain.</p>

<p>Advancing to a period well within the reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
history, we find that early in the Middle Ages
Spain's seigniorial mansions and the houses of
the well-to-do were furnished in a style of rude
magnificence. Roman models, derived from
purely Roman and Byzantine sources through
the Visigoths, continued to remain in vogue
until the tenth or the eleventh century.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Then,
as the fashion of these declined, the furniture
of Christian Spain was modified in turn by
Moorish, Gothic, and Renaissance art; or two of
these would overlap and interact, or even all the
three.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages the furniture of the
eating, sleeping, and living room which formed
the principal apartment in the mansion of a great
seignior, was very much the same throughout the
whole of Christian Europe. Viollet-le-Duc has
described it in the closest detail. The dominant
object, looming in a corner, was the ponderous
bed, transformed into a thing of beauty by its costly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
canopy and hangings.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Throughout the earlier
mediæval times the Spanish bedstead was of iron
or bronze. Wood, plain at first, then richly carved,
succeeded metal towards the fourteenth century,
and with this change the bed grew even vaster
than before. Often it rose so high above the
level of the flooring that the lord and lady required
a set of steps to clamber up to it. These steps
were portable, and sometimes made of solid silver.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
I quote herewith a full description of a mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Spanish bed, extracted from an inventory of the
Princess Juana which was made upon her marriage
with the Count of Foix, in 1392. The same bed
had formerly belonged to Juana's mother, the
Princess Martha, at her marriage with King Juan
the First. It had &ldquo;a velvet canopy with lions
of gold thread, and a dove and a horse confronting
every lion. And each of the lions and doves and
horses bears a lettering; and the lettering of the
lions is <i>Estre por voyr</i>, and that of the doves and
horses <i>aay</i>, and the whole is lined with green
cloth. <i>Item</i>, a counterpane of the said velvet,
with a similar design of doves and lions, and
likewise lined with green cloth. <i>Item</i>, three
curtain-pieces of fine blue silk, with their metal
rings and cords of blue thread. <i>Item</i>, three
cushion-covers of blue velvet, two of them of large
size, bearing two lions on either side, and four
of them small, with a single lion on either side,
embroidered with gold thread; with their linen
coverings. <i>Item</i>, a cloth of a barred pattern, with
the bars of blue velvet and cloth of gold upon a
red ground; which cloth serves for a state-chair
or for a window, and is lined with cloth. <i>Item</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
another cloth made of the said velvet and cloth of
gold, which serves for the small chair (<i>reclinatorio</i>)
for hearing Mass, and is lined with the aforesaid
green cloth. <i>Item</i>, two large linen sheets enveloping
the aforesaid canopy and counterpane. A
pair of linen sheets, of four breadths apiece,
bordered on every side with a handbreadth of silk
and gold thread decoration consisting of various
kinds of birds, leaves, and letters; and each of
the said sheets contains at the head-end about
five handbreadths of the said decoration. <i>Item</i>,
four cushions of the same linen, all of them adorned
all round with about a handbreadth of the aforesaid
decoration of birds, leaves, and letters. <i>Item</i>,
two leather boxes, lined with wool, which contained
all these objects. <i>Item</i>, five canvas-covered
cushions stuffed with feather, for use with the
said six coverings of blue velvet bearing the said
devices. <i>Item</i>, three large pieces of wall tapestry
made of blue wool with the same devices of lions,
horses, and doves, made likewise of wool, yellow
and of other colours. <i>Item</i>, five carpets made
of the aforesaid wool, bearing the same devices.
<i>Item</i>, three coverlets of the same wool, and with
the same devices, for placing on the bed. <i>Item</i>,
a coverlet of red leather bearing in its centre the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
arms of the King and the Infanta. <i>Item</i>, another
coverlet made of leather bars and plain red
leather. <i>Item</i>, a woollen coverlet with the arms
of the Infanta.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Another corner of the room was occupied by
the dining-table,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> spread at meal-times with a
cloth denominated by Saint Isidore the <i>mappa</i>,
<i>mápula</i>, <i>mapil</i>, <i>mantella</i>, or <i>mantellia</i>; and laid
with the <i>mandíbulas</i> or &ldquo;jaw-wipers&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> napkins;
see Du Cange), plates (<i>discos</i>), dishes (<i>mensorios</i>,
<i>messorios</i>, or <i>misorios</i>), spoons (<i>cocleares</i>,
<i>culiares</i>), though not as yet with forks,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> cups of
various shapes and substances, with or without
a cover (<i>copos</i>, <i>vásculos</i>, and many other terms),
the water-flagon (<i>kana</i>, <i>mikana</i>, <i>almakana</i>),
the cruet-stand (<i>canatella</i>), and the salt-cellar
(<i>salare</i>).</p>

<p>This table also served to write upon, while in
its neighbourhood would stand the massive sideboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
piled with gold and silver plate, and vessels
of glass or ivory, wood or alabaster.</p>

<p>Besides the bed and table in their several corners,
the chamber would contain a suitable variety of
chairs and stools, mostly surrounding the capacious
fireplace. Members of the household also sat on
carpets spread upon the floor. The great armchair
of the seignior himself was more ornate than
any of the rest, and was provided somewhat later
with a lofty Gothic back (Plates <a href="#img_10.jpg">i</a>. and <a href="#img_11.jpg">ii</a>.). A
chair with a back of moderate height was destined
for distinguished visitors. The back of
ordinary chairs reached only to about the sitter's
shoulder, and coverings of cloth or other stuffs
were not made fast, but hung quite loosely from the
wooden frame. This usage lasted till the sixteenth
century, when the upholsterers began to nail the
coverings of the larger chairs and benches.</p>

<p>Owing to the oriental influence brought back
from the Crusades, the furniture of Europe, not
excluding Spain, grew ever more elaborate and
costly, while further, in the case of this Peninsula,
the native Moorish influence operated steadily and
strongly from Toledo, Seville, Cordova, Valencia,
and elsewhere. Tapestries of Eastern manufacture
(<i>alcatifas</i>) were now in general use for decorating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
floors and walls. The bed grew more and more
gigantic, and its clothes and curtains more extravagantly
sumptuous, until the florid Gothic woodwork
harmonized with canopies and curtains cut
from priceless skins, or wrought in gold and silver
thread on multicolor satin and brocade. And at
the bed's head, like some jewel marvellously set,
rested, in every noble home, the diptych or the
triptych with its image of the Saviour or the
Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the Renaissance this
love of luxury continued to increase among the
royal and the noble families of Spain. In 1574 an
inventory of the estate of Doña Juana, sister of
Philip the Second, mentions a silver balustrade,
weighing one hundred and twenty-one pounds,
for placing round a bed. The inventory (1560)
of the Dukes of Alburquerque contains a great
variety of entries relative to the furniture and
chamber-fittings of the period. We find here
mentioned, Turkey carpets and the celebrated
Spanish ones of Alcaraz, linens of Rouen, green
cloth of Cuenca, Toledo cloths, hangings of Arras
and elsewhere, tablecovers of damask and of
velvet, gold-fringed canopies (<i>doseles</i>) of green or
crimson velvet or brocade, a &ldquo;canopy for a sideboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of red and yellow Toledo cloth, with the
arms of the La Cuevas in embroidery, together
with stripes and bows, and repetitions of the letter
I (for <i>Isabel Giron</i>, the duchess), also embroidered
fringes of the same cloth, and cords of the aforesaid
colours.&rdquo; We also read of a <i>sitial</i> or state-chair
of crimson satin brocade, and &ldquo;a small
walnut table covered with silver plates, bearing
the arms of my lord the duke and of my lady the
duchess, and edged with silver stripes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
bedstead, fitted with hangings of double taffeta
and scarlet cloth, was no less sumptuous than the
other objects.</p>

</div>

<p>A popular and even an indispensable piece of
furniture in every mediæval Spanish household
was the <i>caja de novia</i> or &ldquo;bride's chest.&rdquo; The use
of this, as well as of a smaller kind of box, was
common both to Moors and Christians. No
matter of what size, these objects were essentially
the same. They served innumerable purposes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
were made of all dimensions&mdash;from the tiniest
casket (<i>arcellina</i>, <i>capsula</i>, or <i>pyxide</i>; see vol. i.,
p. 45 <i>et seq.</i>) to the ponderous and vast <i>arcón</i>,&mdash;and
almost any substance&mdash;ivory or crystal,
mother-of-pearl or glass, gold, silver, copper,
silver-gilt, jasper, agate, or fine wood; and we
find them in every part of the Peninsula, from
the dawn of the Middle Ages till very nearly
the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">II<br />GOTHIC CHAIR<br />
(<i>15th Century</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>According to the Marquis of Monistrol, the
larger boxes or <i>arcones</i> constitute by far the
commonest article of Spanish furniture all through
the earlier portion of this lengthy period. The
same authority divides them broadly into seven
classes, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>(1) Burial-chests.</p>

<p>(2) Chests for storing chasubles, chalices,
candelabra, and other objects connected
with the ceremonies of the church.</p>

<p>(3) Archive-chests, for storing documents.</p>

<p>(4) Chests for storing treasure (<i>huches</i>).</p>

<p>(5) Brides' chests.</p>

<p>(6) Chests for storing arms.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Arcones-trojes</i>, or chests of common
make, employed for storing grain in
country dwellings or <i>posadas</i>.</p></div>

<p>The decorative richness of these quaint <i>arcones</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
varies according to their date of manufacture, or
the purpose they were meant to serve. Commonly,
in the earliest of them, dating from the sixth or
seventh century, the iron clamps or fastenings
form the principal or only ornament. Such are
reported to have been the two chests which the
Cid Campeador loaded with sand and foisted as
filled with specie on his &ldquo;dear friends&rdquo; Rachel
and Vidas, the Jewish though trustful usurers
of Burgos, in return for six hundred marks of
gold and silver. Tradition says, moreover, that
the chest now shown at Burgos as the &ldquo;coffer
of the Cid&rdquo; is actually one of these. It is certain
that the archives of the cathedral have been
deposited in this chest for many centuries.
Evidently, too, it dates from about the lifetime
of the Cid, while the rings with which it is fitted
show it to have been a kind of trunk intended to
be carried on the backs of sumpter-mules or horses.</p>

<p>After the Roman domination in this country, the
Latin term <i>capsa</i> was applied to every kind of
chest; but at a later age sepulchral chests or coffins
were denominated <i>urns</i>, in order to distinguish
them from <i>arcas</i> and <i>arcones</i>, which were used for
storing clothes or jewellery. Excellent examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of Spanish mediæval burial-chests are those of
Doña Urraca, preserved in the Sagrario of the
cathedral of Palencia, and of San Isidro, patron
of Madrid. The former, mentioned by painstaking
Ponz, and by Pulgar in his <i>Secular and
Ecclesiastical Annals of Palencia</i>, is of a plain
design, and really constitutes a coffin. The sepulchral
chest of San Isidro, dating from the end of
the thirteenth century, or the early part of the
fourteenth, and kept at Madrid in a niche of the
<i>camarín</i> of the parish church of San Andrés, is
in the Romanic style, and measures seven feet
six inches in length. It has a gable top, and is
painted in brilliant colours on plaster-coated
parchment, with miracles effected by the saint,
and other scenes related with his life; but much
of the painting is effaced.</p>

<p>Another interesting sepulchral chest would
probably have been the one presented in 1052
by Ferdinand the First, together with his royal
robe and crown,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to the basilica of Saint John
the Baptist at León, to guard the remains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Saint Isidore. This chest was covered with thick
gold plates studded with precious stones, and
bore, in enamel and relief, the figures of the
apostles gathered round the Saviour, and medallions
containing figures of the Virgin, saints, and
martyrs. According to Ambrosio de Morales,
the gold plates were torn off by Alfonso the
First of Aragon, who replaced them by others
of silver-gilt. The same monarch, regardless of
the church's fierce anathema pronounced on all
who dared to touch her property,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is accused by
his chronicler of having appropriated a box of
pure gold studded with gems, enshrining a crucifix
made of the true Cross, and which was kept in
some town or village of the kingdom of León.
Doubtless as a chastisement for Alfonso's impiety,
this precious box was captured from him by the
Moors at the battle of Fraga.</p>

<p>Among the reliquary chests, the oldest specimen
extant in Spain is the <i>arca santa</i> of Oviedo
cathedral. This object, which is purely Byzantine
in its style, is believed to have been made at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Constantinople. It was improved by Alfonso the
Sixth, who added <i>repoussé</i> plates to it, with Arabic
ornamentation in the form of meaningless inscriptions
of a merely decorative character, but which
are interesting as showing the kinship existing at
this time between the Spanish Christians and the
Spanish Moors.</p>

<p>Equally important is the coffer which was made
by order of Don Sancho el Mayor to enshrine the
wonder-working bones of San Millan, and which
is now at San Millan de la Cogulla, in the
province of La Rioja. The author of this chest,
which dates from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1033, is vaguely spoken of
as &ldquo;Master Aparicio.&rdquo; The chest itself consists
of a wooden body beneath a covering of ivory
and gold, further enriched with statuettes and
studded with real and imitation stones. It is
divided into twenty-two compartments carved in
ivory with passages from the life and miracles of
the saint, and figures of &ldquo;princes, monks, and
benefactors,&rdquo; who had contributed in one way or
another to the execution of the reliquary.</p>

<p>I have said that the &ldquo;coffer of the Cid&rdquo; was
made for carrying baggage. A very interesting
Spanish baggage-chest, although more modern
than the Cid's by several centuries, is now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
property of Señor Moreno Carbonero (Plate <a href="#img_16.jpg">iii</a>.).
This very competent authority believes it to have
belonged to Isabella the Catholic, and says that it
was formerly the usage of the sovereigns of this
country to mark their baggage-boxes with the
first quartering of the royal arms and also with
their monogram. Such is the decoration, consisting
of repeated castles and the letter Y (for Ysabel),
upon this trunk. The space between is painted
red upon a surface thinly spread with wax.
Strips of iron, twisted to imitate the girdle of Saint
Francis, are carried over all the frame, surrounding
the castles and the letters. This box was found
at Ronda.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

namely, the end of the fifteenth century, is stated
by its owner, Don Manuel Lopez de Ayala, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

The material is wood, covered inside with dark
blue cloth, and outside with red velvet, most of
the nap of which is worn away. The dimensions
are four feet six inches in length, two feet in
height, and twenty inches in depth. The chest,
which has a triple lock, is covered with <i>repoussé</i>
iron plates representing twisted columns and
other architectural devices, combined with Gothic
thistle-leaves. A coat of arms is on the front.</p>

<p>Such is an outline of the history of these
Spanish chests. Most of the earlier ones are
cumbersome and scantily adorned. Then, as
time proceeds, we find on them the florid Gothic
carving, unsurpassed for purity and charm; then
the Renaissance, with its characteristic ornament of
urns, and birds, and intertwining frond and ribbon;
and finally, towards, and lasting through the
greater portion of, the eighteenth century, the
tasteless and decadent manner of Baroque. Yet
even in the worst and latest we descry from time
to time a flickering remnant of the art of Moorish
Spain.</p>

<p>These Spanish Moors, obedient to the custom
of their fellow-Mussulmans throughout the world,
employed but little furniture. They loved, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
bright colours and ingenious craftsmanship, but
rather in the adjuncts to their furniture than in the
furniture itself; in costly carpets, or worked and
coloured leather hung upon the wall,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> or spread
upon their <i>alhamies</i> and <i>alhanías</i>; in fountains
bubbling in the middle of their courts and halls;
in doors, and ceilings, and <i>celosías</i> exquisitely
carved, and joined with matchless cunning; in
flower-vases placed in niches; in bronze or silver
perfume-burners rolling at their feet; but not
(within the ordinary limit of the term) in furniture.
Upon this theme the Reverend Lancelot Addison
discourses very quaintly. &ldquo;The host here,&rdquo; he
wrote of &ldquo;West Barbary&rdquo; in 1663, &ldquo;is one Cidi
Caffian Shat, a grandee, reported to be an Andalusian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
one of the race of the Moors bansht (<i>sic</i>)
Spain&hellip;. We were called to a little upper
Room, which we could not enter till we had put
off our shoes at the threshold: not for Religion,
but Cleanliness, and not to prevent our unhallowing
the floor, but defiling the carpets wherewith
it was curiously spread. At the upper end of the
Room was laid a Velvit Cushion, as large as
those we use in our Pulpits, and it denoted the
most Honourable part of the Room. After we
had reposed about an hour, there was brought in
a little oval Table, about twenty Inches high, which
was covered with a long piece of narrow linnen;
and this served for Diaper.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> For the Moors, by
their law, are forbidden such superfluous Utensils
as napkins, knives, spoons, etc. Their Religion
laying down the general maxim, that meer
necessaries are to be provided for; which caused
a precise Moor to refuse to drink out of my dish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
when he could sup water enough out of the hollow
of his hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same author proceeds to relate his experiences
at bed-time. &ldquo;Having supp'd and solaced
ourselves with muddy beverage and Moresco
music, we all composed ourselves to sleep: about
twenty were allotted to lodge in this small chamber,
whereof two were Christians, three Jews, and the
rest Moors; every one made his bed of what he
wore, which made our English constitutions to
wish for the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the Mussulmans all this has undergone
no change. Do we not find their present furniture
to be identical with that of distant centuries?&mdash;a
characteristic scarcity of portable articles of
wood; the isolated box (<i>arqueta</i> or <i>arcón</i>) which
serves the purpose of our clumsier chest of drawers
or wardrobe;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> carpets and decorated leathers; the
tiny, indispensable table; the lack of knives and
spoons; ornaments to regale the eye rather than
commodities which the hand might seize upon
and utilize? Such was, and is, and will continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to remain Mohammedan society throughout the
world; and these descriptive passages of life in
seventeenth-century Morocco might have been
penned with equal truth in reference to the Spanish
Muslim of a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>The furniture of the Moorish mosques was also
of the scantiest. &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; to quote once more
from Lancelot Addison's amusing little brochure,
&ldquo;without the too easy accommodations of seats,
pews, or benches. The floor of the Giámma is
handsomely matted, and so are the walls about
two feet high. If the roof be large and weighty,
it is supported with pillars, among which hang
the lamps, which are kept burning all the night.&rdquo;
At one point of his expedition the reason for such
paucity of furniture was vividly expounded to our
tourist. A Moor indignantly exclaimed to him
that it was &ldquo;a shame to see women, dogs, and
dirty shoes brought into a place sacred to God's
worship, and that men &hellip;; should have chaires
there to sit in with as much lascivious ease as at
home.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, a pulpit in the mosque, and a seat
of some kind in the palace or the private house,
were not to be dispensed with. We learn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Ibn-Khaldoun and many other writers, that the
throne of the Mussulman sultans was the <i>mimbar</i>,
<i>takcht</i>, or <i>cursi</i>. Each of these objects was a
wooden seat. The first of the sultans to use a
throne was Moawia, son of Abu-Sofyan. The
princes who came after him continued the same
usage, but displayed a constantly increasing
splendour in the decoration of the throne. This
custom spread, in course of time, from east to west
throughout almost the whole dominion of the
Muslims. The Beni-Nasr princes of Granada
are also known to have used a throne, but this
is believed to have consisted simply of some
cushions piled one upon another. This inference
is drawn by Eguilaz Yanguas and other
Arabists from the old <i>Vocabulary</i> of Fray Pedro
de Alcalá, who renders a &ldquo;throne&rdquo; or &ldquo;royal
seat&rdquo; by <i>martaba</i>, a word equivalent to &ldquo;cushion.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">VI<br />CHAIR AND TABLE<br />
(<i>17th Century. Salamanca Cathedral</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Cushions, too, became symbolic, even with the
Christian Spaniards, of a seat of honour; both
because they lent themselves to rich embroidery
or leather-work, and because they raised their
occupant above the level of the persons seated
positively on the carpet or the floor. In the
painting on the ceiling of the Hall of Justice in the
Alhambra, ten men are congregated in Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
costume, each of them seated on a cushion.
Some writers, including Argote de Molina, Diego
Hurtado de Mendoza, and Hernando del Pulgar,
believed these figures to be actual portraits of the
sultans; others maintain that they depict the
<i>Mizouar</i> or royal council. In either case, however,
the cushion here is clearly an honourable
place. We have, besides, abundant evidence that
the Spanish Christians viewed the cushion with
as marked a liking as their rivals. Alvarez de
Colmenar relates that at the very close of the
seventeenth century the Spanish women sat at
meals in Moorish fashion. &ldquo;Un père de famille
est assis seul à table, et toutes les femmes, sans
exception, mangent par terre, assises sur un
carreau avec leurs enfants, et leur table dressée
sur un tapis étendu.&rdquo; The same work says elsewhere
that &ldquo;lorsque les dames se rendent visite,
elles ne se donnent ni siège ni fauteuil, mais elles
sont toutes assises par terre, les jambes en croix,
sur des tapis ou des carreaux.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, until two centuries ago, the women
of Christian Spain were suffered to take their
seat on cushions of brocade or damask. Only
the men made use of stools or chairs, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to their rank. To &ldquo;give a chair&rdquo; (<i>dar silla</i>) to
a visitor of the male sex was to pay him a valued
courtesy;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and even now the wife of a grandee
of Spain goes through the honourable though
irksome ceremony, at the palace of Madrid, of
&ldquo;taking the cushion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another usage with the Spaniards of the
seventeenth and immediately preceding centuries
was the &ldquo;dais of honour&rdquo; or <i>estrado de cumplimiento</i>.
This was a platform very slightly
raised, and separated by a railing from the rest
of the room. The curious manuscript discovered
by Gayangos, descriptive of court-life at Valladolid
in 1605, contains the following account of one
of the occasions when the Queen, following a
common custom of a Sunday, dined alone, in
sight of all the aristocracy. &ldquo;The table was laid
upon the dais (<i>estrado alto</i>), beneath a canopy of
brocade that overhung the whole of it. The
queen sat at the head of the table, and three ladies,
standing, waited on her; two uncovering the
dishes as they came,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and the third carving. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dishes were brought from the dining-room door
by the <i>meninos</i>, who handed them to the ladies.
Other ladies of the royal household, wives or
daughters of grandees, stood leaning against the
wall in company with gentlemen who, on such
occasions, sue for leave beforehand to attend on
Lady So and So, or So and So. Commonly
there are two such cavaliers to every dame. If
the queen asks for water, one of these ladies takes
it to her, kneels, makes an obeisance, kisses the
goblet, hands it to her majesty, and retires to her
appointed place. Behind the queen was one of
her chamberlains. Many of the Englishmen
were witnessing the meal. They always put the
English first on such occasions; and as they are
such hulking fellows (God bless them!) I, who
was at their back, scarce noted anything of what
was passing, and only saw that many plates went
to and fro.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Solid and expensive furniture continued to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
used in Spain throughout the sixteenth and the
seventeenth centuries; the ponderous chest, the
ponderous brasier, ponderous stools, ponderous
armchairs with massive nails and coverings of
velvet or of decorated leather (Plates <a href="#img_20.jpg">v</a>v., <a href="#img_22.jpg">vi</a>., and
<a href="#img_24.jpg">vii</a>.). Upon the wall, the tapestry of earlier
times was often replaced by paintings of a sacred
character, or family portraits. The comedy titled
<i>La Garduña de Sevilla</i>, written about the middle
of the seventeenth century by Alonso del Castillo
Solorzano, describes the interior of a rich man's
dwelling of this period. &ldquo;Upstairs Rufina noted
delicate summer hangings, new chairs of Moscovy
cowhide, curiously carved buffets, and ebony and
ivory writing-desks; for Marquina, though a
skinflint towards others, was generous in the
decoration of his own abode&hellip;. When dinner
was over, he took her to a room embellished with
fine paintings, and with a bed whose canopy was
of some Indian fabric&hellip;. Paintings by famous
masters were plentifully hung about the house,
together with fine Italian hangings, various kinds
of writing-desks, and costly beds and canopies.
When they had visited nearly all the rooms, they
opened the door of one which contained a beautiful
altar and its oratory. Here were a great array<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of costly and elaborate Roman vessels, agnuses
of silver and of wood, and flowers arranged in
various ways. This chamber, too, was full of
books distributed in gilded cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A characteristic piece of Spanish furniture was
at this time the solid-looking cabinet known as the
<i>vargueño</i>, so denominated from the little town
of Vargas, near Toledo, formerly a well-known
centre of their manufacture. These cabinets,
whose origin, according to the Marquis of Monistrol,
may be traced to a fifteenth-century form of
<i>huche</i>, or chest provided with drawers for guarding
articles of value, and which opened in the centre,
are commonly made of walnut. The front lets
down upon a massive wooden rest supported by the
legs, and forms a folding writing-table containing at
the back a number of drawers or compartments for
storing documents, or other things of minor bulk.</p>

<p>The woodwork of these cabinets is often without
carving; but generally in such cases their bareness
is relieved by massive and elaborately ornamented
iron fastenings and a decorative key.</p>

<p>The Ordinances of Granada tell us that in
1616 the making of defective furniture had grown
to be a scandal in that town. The cause, it
seems, was partly in the wood itself, proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from the Sierra de Segura, Pinar del Duque, and
the Sierra de Gor. &ldquo;Divers of our carpenters
and joiners cut their walnut and other woods
while yet the moon is crescent, whereby the wood
decays and spoils. Others there be that make
and sell chairs, desks, beds, and other furniture
of green unseasoned wood which warps and
loosens, insomuch that within some days the
article is worthless. Therefore we order that
all walnut wood and other woods for making
furniture be only cut at the time of the waning
moon, and be not used until they shall have
seasoned thoroughly, so as not to warp; and that
they be approved by the inspectors of this trade,
under a penalty of six thousand <i>maravedis</i> for
each of the aforesaid Ordinances that be not
complied with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The municipal laws of the same city relative
to the &ldquo;chair-makers who make hip-chairs to sit
in, and leather-covered chests,&rdquo; were cried, in
1515 and 1536, &ldquo;in the street of the chairmakers
and carpenters.&rdquo; Fettered by irksome regulations
of this kind, we cannot wonder that the arts and
crafts of Christian Spain were fated to decline.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Owing to the &ldquo;false and faulty workmanship&rdquo; prevailing
in Granada, it is provided by these statutes
that the wood employed in making chairs must
be bought by the manufacturers in public auction
only, held &ldquo;in the little square where dwell the
chairmakers.&rdquo; It must be thoroughly dry and
free from flaws, and of sufficient stoutness to
sustain the decorative marquetry. The chair
which lacks these requisite conditions must be
seized and burnt. The four nails which fasten
the seat of the chair to the legs must traverse the
frame completely and be hammered back upon
the other side, unless the surface of the chair
be inlaid, in which case they need not pass
completely through. The leather for the seats
and backs of chairs must be good in quality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
well prepared and dressed, besides being strongly
sewn with flaxen thread. Chairs of all sizes
must bear the official city mark, stamped by the
authorities at a charge of one <i>maravedi</i> for each
of the large chairs and a <i>blanca</i> for each of the
small.</p>

<p>Makers of the leather-covered chests are
ordered to use the hides of horses, mares, or
mules, and not the hides of oxen, cows, or calves,
because, if covered with this latter, &ldquo;the chests
grow moth-eaten and are destroyed much sooner.&rdquo;
The craftsman who transgresses this command
must lose the faulty piece of furniture, and pay four
hundred <i>maravedis</i>, while under a further penalty
of two hundred <i>maravedis</i> the hinges must be
fixed inside the chest, and not to its exterior.</p>

<p>I have omitted hitherto all mention of the
furnishing of humbler Spanish houses in the olden
time. The following passage from the Ordinances
of Granada shows us, referring to an inn, an
unpretentious lodging of about four hundred
years ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Item.</i> If the innkeeper have a parlour or
alcove that fastens with a lock, and therein a
bed of the better class, with hangings round
about it, and a canopy above, and on the bed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
counterpane, friezed blanket, and pillows; also a
bench with its strip of carpet or striped benchcloth,
a table with its service of tablecloths and
all that be needful, besides a lamp of brass or
ware, all of the best that he is able to provide&mdash;for
such a bed and room he may demand twelve
<i>maravedis</i> each day; whether the room be taken
by one guest, or two, or more.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the Spanish inn more comfortable in
the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries than in
the sixteenth. &ldquo;On entre d'ordinaire dans les
Hôtelleries par l'écurie, du moins dans de certaines
Provinces; on vous mène dans quelque chambre,
où vous trouvez les quatre parois, quelquefois un
bois de lit; pour chandelle on allume un grand
nombre de petites bougies, qui font assez de
lumière pour voir ce que vous mangez; et afin
que l'odeur and la fumée de tant de bougies
n'incommode pas, on vous apporte, si vous le
souhaitez, un brasier de noyaux d'olives en
charbon. Quand on monte, on trouve au haut de
l'escalier, la <i>Señora de la Casa</i>, qui a eu le tems
de prendre ses beaux habits de dimanche pour
vous faire honneur et s'en faire à elle-même.&rdquo;
(Alvarez de Colmenar, in 1715.)</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare these passages with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Lancelot Addison's account of a Morocco inn
towards the middle of the seventeenth century;
bearing in mind that <i>fonda</i>, the current Spanish
term for <i>hostelry</i>, is common both to Spain and to
Morocco:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In later years, every town of traffic hath
erected a sort of Inns called <i>Alfándach</i>, which
affords nothing but House-room for man and
beast, the market yielding provision for both.
Those that farm these <i>fandáchs</i> cannot exact
above a Blankil a night both for man and beast,
which is in sterling money about two pence. The
horses lodging costing equally with his Rider's.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, the keeper of the older Spanish inn
was not allowed by law to traffic in provisions.
&ldquo;Nothing but house-room&rdquo; was available for wayfarers,
and the weary visitor, as soon as ever he
arrived, must sally forth to do his marketing.</p>

<p>The statements in this passage relative to the
lack of food in Spanish hostelries are confirmed,
nearly a century later, by Townsend, who records
that on reaching a certain village his first proceeding
was to turn his steps, not to the <i>fonda</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<i>posada</i> where he would engage his bed, but to
the butcher's, wine-seller's, and so forth, &ldquo;to see
what was to be had, as I had travelled all day
fasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is beyond the province of this work to dwell
upon the foreign taste in furniture which invaded
Spain from France upon the advent of the
Bourbon dynasty, and so I limit my notice of the
eighteenth century to quoting from Laborde the
following comprehensive passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Spaniards,&rdquo; this traveller wrote in
1809, &ldquo;take many precautions against heat, they
take scarcely any against cold; it is very uncommon
to find doors or windows that shut
close, and the rooms are very little and very
ill-warmed. The use of chimneys even is very
uncommon, and only prevails in the houses of
such Spaniards as have travelled. Brasiers of
copper or silver are generally employed, which
are set in the middle of the apartment, filled
with burning charcoal, and round which the family
place themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;The beds in Spain are hard. They are only
made of mattresses, more or fewer, laid on paillasses
which rest upon a boarded bottom; for
neither sacking nor feather beds are known. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bolsters are used, but in their place little, short,
flat pillows are heaped up, sometimes to the
number of six or eight. The sheets are in
general short and narrow; and napkins scarcely
as big as a small pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The furniture of the houses is usually very
simple. The floor is covered with a matting of
<i>esparto</i> in winter, and of rushes or palm leaves in
summer. A matting of the same kind, a painted
cloth, or painting in panels, covers the walls
from the floor to the height of four or five feet;
above, the wall is bare, painted white, and adorned
with pictures of saints and a kind of ornamented
metal chandeliers; these are covered with a glass,
surrounded with a border of gilt ornaments; and
a little branch of gilt copper proceeds from them
forming zig-zags or festoons, on which the candles
are placed; they are called cornucopias; they are
from one to three feet in height, and give the
apartment the air of a coffee room, or billiard room.
Mirrors are placed between the windows, and a
lustre of clear glass in imitation of crystal is suspended
from the middle of the handsomest
saloons. The chairs have straw bottoms; in
some provinces, as Murcia, Andalusia, and
Valencia, they are of different heights; those on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
one side of the room being of the common height,
and the others one third lower. The latter are
intended for the ladies. In some of the principal
cities one also sees chairs and sofas of walnut
wood, the backs of which are bare, and the
seats covered with damask; usually crimson or
yellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luxury begins, however, to show itself in
these objects. In the chief cities many hangings
are of painted paper or linen; even hangings of
brocades, of one and of three colours, and of
various other kinds of silk; large and beautiful
mirrors, and a number of sofas may be seen.
The houses of the grandees in Madrid are
magnificently furnished, but usually with more
cost than taste. Hangings of silk, velvet, and
damask, adorned with rich fringes and gold embroidery,
are very common, and the seats are of
corresponding magnificence. Many houses in
Barcelona, Cadiz, Valencia, and Madrid are
decorated with equal study and elegance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The custom of painting the walls is of late
introducing itself into Spain. They are covered
with representations of men and animals, with
trees, flowers, landscapes, houses, urns, vases, or
history pieces, divided into compartments, adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with pillars, pilasters, friezes, cornices, and arabesques;
the effect of the whole is often very
agreeable. This kind of decoration was imported
from Italy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In this account we clearly trace each various
and successive influence that had permeated older
Spain, leaving her, at the close of every period, a
nation that produced illustrious artists, but never
a nation deeply versed in, or devoted to, the arts.
The beds and brasiers of these modern Spaniards
were derived from ancient Rome; their general
dearth of comfortable furniture, together with the
lower, and therefore more humiliating, seats for
women, from the Spanish Moors; the typically
ponderous hangings from mediæval Spain herself;
the fresco wall-paintings, such as may still
be seen in many a Spanish country home, from
classic or Renaissance Italy; and the finicking
gilt, rococo cornucopias from France; while the
use of mirrors and of lustres in hideous combination
with straw-bottomed chairs, almost reminds us
of the days of Visigothic barbarism.</p>

<h3>LEATHER</h3>

<p><i>Guadamacilería</i>, or the art of decorating leather
with painting, gilding, and impressions in relief,
is commonly believed to have crossed from Africa
to Spain at some time in the Middle Ages.
According to Duveyrier, the word <i>guadamecí</i> or
<i>guadamecil</i> is taken from Ghadames, a town in
Barbary where the craft was practised long ago;
but Covarrubias gives it an origin directly
Spanish, supposing that the title and the craft
alike proceeded from a certain town of Andalusia.
However this may be, the preparation of these
leathers grew to be a most important industry in
various parts of Spain, and spread, as time went
on, to Italy, France, and other European
countries.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p class="caption">XIV<br />DOOR OF THE CAPILLA DE LOS VARGAS<br />
(<i>Madrid</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>In the Peninsula, the principal centres of this
work were Cordova, Seville, Lerida, Barcelona,
Ciudad Real, and Valladolid. Cordova, however,
was so far ahead of all the rest that leathers
decorated in this style were known throughout
the world as <i>cueros de Córdoba</i>, or &ldquo;Cordova<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
leathers.&rdquo; Another name for them is said to
have been <i>cordobanes</i>; but possibly the application
of this latter word was less restricted.
Bertaut de Rouen wrote in the seventeenth
century of Ciudad Real:&mdash;&ldquo;C'est une ville située
dans une grande plaine, et dont l'enceinte est
assez grande, qui estoit mesme fort peuplée
autrefois, mais elle est quasi deserte à present.
Il ne luy reste plus rien sinon que c'est là où l'on
appreste le mieux les peaux de <i>Cordouan</i>, dont
on fait les gans d'Espagne. C'est delà aussi d'où
elles viennent pour la pluspart à Madrid. J'en
achetay quelques-unes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1197 Alfonso the Ninth presented the town
of Castro de los Judíos to León Cathedral and
its bishop, confirming at the same time the
tribute which the Jews who occupied that town
were bound to render upon Saint Martin's day
in every year, and which consisted of two hundred
<i>sueldos</i>, a fine skin, and two <i>guadamecís</i>. This
tribute had existed since the reign of Ferdinand
the First: that is, towards the middle of the
preceding century.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>None of these primitive leathers now exist, and
consequently the details of their workmanship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
have perished with them. Ramírez de Arellano
mentions two small coffers in the Cluny Museum,
which date from about the fourteenth century
and are decorated with the forms of animals
cut from leather and overlaid on velvet. Other
<i>guadamecís</i>, though not of the oldest, are in
the South Kensington Museum. &ldquo;The earliest
<i>guadamecileros</i>,&rdquo; says Ramírez de Arellano, speaking
particularly of this art at Cordova, &ldquo;were accustomed
to imitate brocade upon their leathers,
employing beaten silver together with the colours
red, green, blue, black, white, and carmine,
applied in oils, or sometimes (although the law
prohibited this) in tempera. Gold was not used
till 1529, when Charles the Fifth confirmed
the Ordinances of this industry. The leather-workers
tanned the hides themselves, stamping
the pattern from a wooden mould, and then
(if we may call it so) engraving on them.
The hides were those of rams. The spaces
between the decoration were either coloured
red or blue, or simply left the colour of the
skin; or else the pattern would be wrought in
colours on the natural hide. Gold, which at a
later epoch almost totally replaces silver, was
introduced between 1529 and 1543, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
applied as follows. The artists smeared with oil
the parts they wished to figure in raised or sunk
relief, and laid the beaten gold upon the oil.
They then applied a heated iron or copper mould;
the pattern in relief was stamped; and the gold,
superfluous shreds of which were wiped away with
lint, adhered upon the leather. The irons required
to be moderately hot, because if overheated
they would burn the hide, or, if not hot enough,
the fixing of the gold would not be permanent.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">XV<br />MUDEJAR DOOR<br />

</div>

<p>The importance of this industry in Spain may
be judged of from the fact that towards the close
of the Middle Ages the <i>guadamacileros</i> of Seville
occupied nearly the whole of an important street&mdash;the
Calle Placentines. Similarly, at Cordova
they filled the quarter of the city known as the
Ajerquía. &ldquo;So many <i>guadamecíes</i> are made here,&rdquo;
wrote Ambrosio de Morales, &ldquo;that in this craft no
other capital can compare with her; and in such
quantities that they supply all Europe and the
Indies. This industry enriches Cordova and
also beautifies her; for since the gilded, wrought,
and painted leathers are fixed upon large boards
and placed in the sun in order to be dried, by
reason of their splendour and variety they make
her principal streets right fair to look upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We owe to Rafael Ramírez de Arellano most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
valuable and recent information respecting this
ancient Spanish-Moorish craft.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He has discovered
the names of nearly forty <i>guadamacileros</i>
who lived and worked at Cordova, principally in
the sixteenth century. It is not worth while to
repeat these names alone, but one or two
particulars connected with a few of them are
interesting. In 1557 four of these artificers,
named Benito Ruiz, Diego de San Llorente,
Diego de Ayora, and Anton de Valdelomar, signed
a contract to prepare the cut and painted <i>guadamaciles</i>
for decorating a palace at Rome. This contract,
which is most precise and technical, is
published in No. 101 of the <i>Boletín de la Sociedad
Española de Excursiones</i>. The only further notice
which Señor Ramírez de Arellano has discovered
relating to any of these four craftsmen, tells us
that nine years after the signing of the document
just mentioned, Diego de Ayora leased some
houses in the Calle de la Feria for a yearly rental
of twenty-two ducats and three pairs of live hens.</p>

<p>Another interesting contract is dated April
17th, 1587. By it the <i>guadamacilero</i> Andrés<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Lopez de Valdelomar agreed, in company with
Hernando del Olmo of Marchena, and with
Francisco de Gaviria and Francisco Delgado,
painters, of Cordova, to make a number of pieces
of <i>guadamecí</i> for the Duke of Arcos. The work
was to be terminated by July of the same year.
Valdelomar was to receive from the duke's agent
three <i>reales</i> for each piece, and the painters two
<i>reales</i> and a half; this money to be paid them by
instalments as the work proceeded.</p>

<p class="caption">XVI<br /><i>CELOSÍA</i><br />
(<i>Alhambra, Granada</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>On August 26th, 1567, before the mayor of
Cordova and the two inspectors of this trade, Pedro
de Blancas was officially examined and approved
in &ldquo;cutting, working, and completing a <i>guadamecí</i>
of red damask with gold and silver borders on a
green field, and a cushion with green and crimson
decoration and faced with silver brocade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ordinances of Cordova also tell us much
about this industry. The oldest of these city laws
which deal with it are dated 1529. Those of 1543
were ratified by a Crown pragmatic early in the
seventeenth century, and at this later date we
learn that the craft had much declined, the leather
being by now &ldquo;of wretched quality, the colouring
imperfect, and the pieces undersized.&rdquo; The
Ordinances published in the sixteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
provide that every applicant for official licence to
pursue this craft and open business as a <i>guadamacilero</i>,
must prove himself, in presence of the
examiners, able to mix his colours and design with
them, and to make a canopy together with its
fringe, as well as &ldquo;a cushion of any size or style
that were demanded of him; nor shall he explain
merely by word of mouth the making of the same,
but make it with his very hands in whatsoever
house or place shall be appointed by the mayor
and the overseers of the craft aforesaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was also provided by these Ordinances that
the pieces of leather were to be dyed, not with
Brazil-wood, but with madder, and that their size,
whether the hide were silvered, gilt, or painted,
was to be strictly uniform, namely, &ldquo;the size of
the primitive mould,&rdquo; or &ldquo;three-quarters of a yard
in length by two-thirds of a yard, all but one inch,
in width.&rdquo; The standard measures, made of iron
and stamped with the city seal, were guarded under
lock and key; and the Ordinances of 1567 establish
the penalty of death for every <i>guadamacilero</i> who
shall seek, in silvering his wares, to palm off tin
for silver.</p>

<p>These leathers served a great variety of
purposes, public or private, sacred or profane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
They were used upon the walls and floors of
palaces and castles, as table-covers, counterpanes,
bed-hangings, cushions, curtains for doors, linings
for travelling-litters, coverings of chests and
boxes,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and seats and backs of chairs and
benches (Plate <a href="#img_24.jpg">vii</a>.). In churches and cathedrals,
especially throughout the sixteenth century, we
find them used as tapestry and carpets,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> altar-fronts
(such as one which is preserved in the

crowns for images of the Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> As time
advanced, gold and a coat or so of colour was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
succeeded by elaborate painting. Thus painted,
they were often cut into the forms of columns,
pilasters, or friezes in the Plateresco or Renaissance
style,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> until the growing popularity of wall-pictures,
together with the importation of French
fashions at the death of Charles the Second,
crippled and ultimately killed the decorative
leather industry of Spain.</p>

<h3>CARPENTRY AND WOOD-CARVING</h3>

<p>The artistic carpentry of older Spain produced
as its most typical and striking monuments, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
groups of objects which may be included generally
under Furniture. These are the <i>celosía</i> or
window-lattice, the door of <i>lazo</i>-work, and the
<i>artesonado</i>-ceiling which adorns a hall or chamber,
corridor or staircase.</p>

<p class="caption">XVIII<br />CARVED <i>ZAPATAS</i><br />
(<i>Casa de Salinas, Salamanca</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>These happy and effective styles of decoration
came originally from the East. Their passage
may be traced along the coast of Africa from
Egypt into Spain; and they flourished in Spain
for the same reason which had caused them to
flourish at Cairo. &ldquo;When we remember,&rdquo; says
Professor Lane-Poole, &ldquo;how little wood grows
in Egypt, the extensive use made of this material
in the mosques and houses of Cairo appears very
remarkable. In mosques, the ceilings, some of
the windows, the pulpit, lectern or Koran desk,
tribune, tomb-casing, doors, and cupboards, are
of wood, and often there are carved wooden inscriptions
and stalactites of the same material leading
up to the circle of the dome. In the older
houses, ceilings, doors, cupboards, and furniture
are made of wood, and carved lattice windows, or
meshrebiyas, abound. In a cold climate, such
employment of the most easily worked of substances
is natural enough; but in Egypt, apart
from the scarcity of the material, and the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of importing it, the heat offers serious obstacles
to its use. A plain board of wood properly
seasoned may keep its shape well enough in
England, but when exposed to the sun of Cairo
it will speedily lose its accurate proportions; and
when employed in combination with other pieces,
to form windows or doors, boxes or pulpits, its
joints will open, its carvings split, and the whole
work will become unsightly and unstable. The
leading characteristic of Cairo wood-work is its
subdivision into numerous panels; and this
principle is obviously the result of climatic considerations,
rather than any doctrine of art. The
only mode of combating the shrinking and
warping effects of the sun was found in a skilful
division of the surfaces into panels small enough,
and sufficiently easy in their setting, to permit
of slight shrinking without injury to the general
outline. The little panels of a Cairo door or
pulpit may expand without encountering enough
resistance to cause any cracking or splitting in
the surrounding portions, and the Egyptian workmen
soon learned to accommodate themselves to
the conditions of their art in a hot climate.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>These valuable and interesting observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
apply with equal justice to the decorative woodwork
of the Spanish Muslims. A further point
of interest lies in the fact that window-grilles and
ceilings of the kind referred to, grew to be extremely
fashionable through the whole Peninsula.
Carried by Moorish or Mudejar craftsmen far
beyond the frontiers of the Mussulman sultans of
this European land, we find to-day surviving
specimens in every part of Spain&mdash;most of them,
it is true, in sultry Andalus; but many also in the
old seigniorial mansions of Castile, or even in
the cold and humid towns and cities of Cantabria.</p>

<p>The man who did this kind of work was not a
common carpenter. Such work was largely practical
and prosaic, but also it was largely decorative
and poetical. Probably, both in his own and in
his customer's regard, the decorative quality was
set before the practical. Therefore, beyond the
dry, comparatively facile details of technique, this
workman studied, with an artist's reverence and
zeal, the inner, subtler, sweeter mysteries of line
and form; harmonies of curve and angle; patterns,
now geometrical, now floral, now these two combined
with magic ingenuity; steeping himself in
the æsthetic sense; making, indeed, his work the
literal fact or fitting of prosaic application that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was indispensable; but also, and as if upon some
loftier initiative of his own, a miracle of art for
people of a later day to come and stand before
and wonder at.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Indeed, whether because Our Lord had practised
it, or from some other motive, carpentry was
always well esteemed among the Spaniards. The
Ordinances of Seville eulogize it, in conjunction
with its sister-work of masonry and building, as
&ldquo;a noble art and self-contained, that increaseth
the nobleness of the King and of his kingdom,
that pacifieth the people, and spreadeth love
among mankind, conducing to much good.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The
same Ordinances divide these honourable craftsmen
into half a dozen classes and sub-classes;
carvers or <i>entalladores</i>, carpenters who kept a shop
(<i>carpinteros de tienda</i>), <i>carpinteros de lo prieto</i>,
and <i>carpinteros de lo blanco</i>. The latter are the
class we are considering here, and these, in turn,
were subdivided into <i>lazeros</i> or makers of <i>lazo</i>-work,
<i>non-lazeros</i> or those who did not make it,
and <i>jumetricos</i> or <i>geómetricos</i>. The statutory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
examination was severe in all these branches.
Thus, the <i>lazero</i>-carpenters of Seville were required
to make a chamber of octagonal <i>lazo</i>-work,
including its pendentives at the corners; while
the wood-carvers of the same city were required
to be experienced draughtsmen and to make
and carve &ldquo;artistic altar-screens with decorated
columns, pedestals for images, and tabernacles (<i>i.e.</i>
the part of an altar where the cibory and the Host
are kept), as well as tombs and chambranles
with their covering, tabernacles of the utmost art
(<i>de grande arte</i>), and rich choir-stalls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor was the making of artistic ceilings, doors,
and window-gratings carried out exclusively by
men of Moorish blood. Tutored by these, the
Christians practised it with great success. Prominent
among these last we find, early in the
seventeenth century, the name of Diego Lopez
de Arenas, a Christian-Spaniard and a native of
Marchena, who held the licensed title of master-carpenter
and lived for many years at Seville.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
In a lucky moment it occurred to Lopez de
Arenas to write and publish for the benefit of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
fellow-craftsmen a book upon this decorative
oriental woodwork that had passed into the
Spanish national life. This book, <i>Carpintería
de lo Blanco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> appeared at Seville in 1633, and
fresh editions were printed at the same city
in 1727, and at Madrid in 1867. As in the
Ordinances of Granada, Seville, and Toledo,
Arabic terms, too copious and too complicated for
elucidation here, are constantly repeated in this
book.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Much of the general information which
we gather from it is, however, of great interest.
Thus, we are told that with the Spanish artists,
as in Egypt, the wood most often used, no doubt
as being the cheapest, was pitch pine, parcelled
and put together in the most elaborate decorative
schemes. Such was the characteristic <i>alfarge</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
ceiling of the Moorish, Morisco, and Spanish-Christian
<i>carpintero de lo blanco</i>. Its many fragments
were secured upon the frame by long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
small-headed nails, or by these nails combined
with glue. If we observe the ceilings from
close by, as when, for instance, they are taken
down to be restored, the workmanship appears
to be coarse, inaccurate, and hasty; the myriad
pieces to be clumsily and loosely joined; the nails
to be driven in without method, or even awry.
Nevertheless, this false effect betrays the calculating
genius of the craftsman. He planned his
work for contemplation by a certain light and at
a certain elevation; and therefore, as the ceiling
is removed again to its appointed distance, it
seems to re-create itself in proud defiance of an
error of our own, and grows at once to its habitual
delicacy, harmony, and richness.</p>

<p>I have said that the decoration of these ceilings
is sometimes floral, sometimes geometrical, sometimes
a combination of the two.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Sometimes the
wood is plain, or sometimes silvered, gilt, or
painted. Sometimes it is employed alone, or
sometimes variegated and inlaid with plaster
points and patches. By far the commonest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
motive is the <i>lazo</i>&mdash;an ornamental scheme composed
of infinite strips that turn, and twist, and
intersect, describing in their mazy passage many
polygons. One of these polygons determines,
in a way, the scheme of the entire ceiling, which
is denominated as consisting of &ldquo;a <i>lazo</i> of eight,&rdquo;
&ldquo;of ten,&rdquo; &ldquo;of twelve,&rdquo; etc., from this particular.
The most attractive and most frequent is the
scheme &ldquo;of eight.&rdquo; Among the decorative details
used to brighten and enhance the <i>lazo</i>
proper are <i>mocarabes</i> or wooden lacery for relieving
cubes and joists or surfaces, and <i>rácimos</i>
or &ldquo;clusters&rdquo;; that is, hollow or solid wooden
cones or prisms, disposed along the side and centre
panels of the ceiling like (in Arenas' ingenious
phrase) the buttons on a jacket, and contributing
to the massive aspect of the whole. These
clusters, too, were sometimes in the stalactite and
sometimes in a simpler form, and show, both in
the quantity and richness of their ornament, a
limitless diversity.</p>

<p>Magnificent Spanish-Moorish, Spanish, and
Mudejar ceilings still exist in Spain. Such are
the marvellous domed ceiling in the Hall of
Comares (or of Ambassadors) in the Alhambra,
those of the Castle of the Aljafería at Zaragoza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and of the archbishop's palace at Alcalá de
Henares, the Arab <i>alfarge</i> ceilings in the
churches of San Francisco and Santiago of
Guadix, that of the Hall of Cortes in the Audiencia
of Valencia, that of the Sala Capitular of Toledo
Cathedral, that of the Chapel of the Holy Spirit
of the Cathedral of Cuenca (considered by many
to be the finest <i>artesonado</i> ceiling in all Spain),
or those of the churches of Jesus Crucificado,
El Carmen, and San Pablo at Cordova. The
ceiling of the Sala de la Barca, in the Moorish
palace of the Alhambra, was almost totally destroyed
by fire in 1890, but a good photograph
had previously been taken, and I reproduce it
here (Plate <a href="#img_26.jpg">viii</a>.). One of the later <i>artesonado</i>
ceilings is at Cordova, in the parish church
of Santiago. Covered with a <i>bóveda</i> or vault
of cane, it is in excellent preservation, and was
made in 1635 by the master-carpenter Alonso
Muñoz de los Ríos, who received for his labour
fourteen thousand <i>reales</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The <i>artesonado</i> ceilings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
which Diego Lopez de Arenas tells us in his
treatise that he made for the church, the choir,
and the <i>sobreescalera</i> of the monastery of Santa
Paula at Seville, as well as a ceiling which he
made for the church of Mairena, are all extant
to-day. Other remarkable examples of this craft
are the ceilings of the rooms constructed to the
order of, and which were actually occupied by,
Charles the Fifth, within the precincts of the old
Alhambra. Upon these half-Italian, half-Morisco
ceilings and their frieze we read the words, &ldquo;<i>Plus
Oultre</i>&rdquo;; and the inscription, &ldquo;<i>Imperator Cæsar
Karolus V. Hispaniarum rex semper augustus pius
f&oelig;lix invictissimus</i>.&rdquo; In one of the same apartments,
known as the &ldquo;chamber of the fruits,&rdquo; the
ceiling has octagonal <i>artesones</i> of superb effect,
though even richer is that of what is called
the Second Sala de las Frutas, conspicuously
influenced by Italian art, and believed by Gómez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Moreno to have been designed by Pedro Machuca
and executed by Juan de Plasencia.</p>

<p>Marvellous in conjunction with the thousand
lighted lamps which served to manifest its beauties,
must have been the primitive ceiling (<i>as-sicafes</i>)
of the mosque of Cordova, of which an Arab poet
sang; &ldquo;Look at the gold on it, like the kindled
flame, or like the lightning-stroke that darts
across the heavens.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Our notices of this ceiling,
barbarously hacked to pieces by Christian architects,
are neither numerous nor clear. We are
told, however, that it was nearly finished in the
reign of Abd-er-Rhaman the First, and terminated
altogether by his son Hixem. New ceilings were
added on the enlarging of the mosque by Abd-er-Rhaman
the Second, while fresh additions were
made by Al-Hakem the Second and Al-Manzor.
Ambrosio de Morales gives a quaint description
of the earliest, or an early, ceiling of this temple.
&ldquo;The roof of the whole church, made of wood
painted and adorned in divers ways, is of incredible
richness, as will be seen from what I am about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
say. It is of larch throughout, odorous, resembling
pine, which is not found in any part but Barbary,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
whence it is brought by sea. And every time
that a part of this temple was thrown down for
new constructions to be added, the wood removed
was sold for many thousand ducats for making
guitars and other delicate objects. The ceiling
was built across the church upon the nineteen
naves thereof, and over it, covered likewise
with wood, the roofs, nineteen in number also,
each with its ridge atop, drooping to one and
other side.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Three pieces made of common pine, and which
are thought to have belonged to the original ceiling
of this mosque or to an early replica, are
now in the National Museum at Madrid, but the
carving of these fragments is so simple that in
the opinion of Rodrigo Amador de los Ríos the
decoration of the wood itself was purposely subordinated
in this instance to the richness and
variety of the painting.</p>

<p>Three types of decorative doors were made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
older Spain. In the earliest and simplest (<i>lacería
en talla</i>), the <i>lacería</i> or <i>lazo</i>-work is carved directly
on and from the solid plank which forms the body
of the door. In the second type, the carver's art
is delicately blended with the joiner's&mdash;<i>lazo</i>-work
with <i>ensamblaje</i>. In the third type the <i>lazo</i>-work
is <i>sobrepuesta</i>&mdash;that is, attached to, not elaborated
from, the planking.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>As in the case of ceilings, many and excellent
examples of these doors exist to-day in Spain.
Among the most remarkable are several in the
Moorish palace of the Alhambra, such as the two
(dating from the end of the fourteenth century or
early in the fifteenth) belonging, respectively, to
the famous Hall of the Abencerrajes (Pl. <a href="#img_28.jpg">ix</a>.), and
to the Hall of the Two Sisters (Pl. <a href="#img_30.jpg">x</a>.). Apparently
it was the former of these doors which Bertaut de
Rouen wrote of in the seventeenth century as
&ldquo;une porte aussi grande et aussi épaisse comme
celles de nos plus grandes églises. Elle s'ouvre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
des deux costez, et est toute de pieces rapportées,
et d'un bois de differentes couleurs, comme les
beaux cabinets et les belles tables qui coustent si
cher.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>An early Mudejar door proceeding from the
church of San Pedro at Daroca in Aragon is now
in the National Museum. This door, which is
of larch, and measures nearly fourteen feet in
height by nine in breadth, is of a simple design and
represents a horse-shoe door described within the
door itself. It was originally painted vermilion,
with other decorative painting of a simple character
in black, white, and red, and is fortified with
massive iron braces. It is believed to date from
earlier than the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The mighty doors of the &ldquo;Hall of Ambassadors,&rdquo;
in the mediæval royal residence of Seville (Plates
<a href="#img_32.jpg">xi</a>. and <a href="#img_34.jpg">xii</a>.), are quite the finest to be seen in Spain.
Although a widespread superstition assigns their
manufacture to a period close upon the Moorish
conquest, it has been proved conclusively that
they were made by Mudejar craftsmen of Toledo
at the time when the whole Alcázar was erected
more or less upon the ruins of the old, by Pedro
the First of Castile, denominated, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the prejudice with which we view his character,
&ldquo;the Cruel,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Just.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>These doors, which under a pretence of restoration
have been mutilated more than once, are
made of larch, and measure sixteen feet in height
by thirteen feet (including both the leaves) in
width. The upper part of either leaf consists of
geometrical and floral ornament in exquisitely
tasteful combination, executed in the scheme known
technically, from the angles at the central polygon,
as <i>lazo de á doce</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>lazo</i>-work of twelve.&rdquo; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
decoration of the lower part is more minute, and in
the scheme of <i>lazo de á diez</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>lazo</i>-work of ten.&rdquo;
Inscriptions in Arabic and Latin, many of which
are quoted from the Psalms, are distributed on
both sides of the woodwork, and confirm our other
evidence that the doors were made during the
reign and in obedience to the orders, of Don Pedro.</p>

<p>The Plateresco sixteenth-century doors of the
Capilla de los Vargas at Madrid (Plate <a href="#img_38.jpg">xiv</a>.) are
attributed by Cean Bermudez and by Ponz to an
artist named Giralte, who carved them in walnut
with various military and other scenes from Scripture,
alternating with shields and floral ornament;
the whole surrounded by an exquisitely delicate
and tasteful border. Lampérez remarks that the
errors of perspective recall the similar productions
of Ghiberti.</p>

<p>The <i>celosía</i> or decorative wooden window-grating,
imported by the Mussulman conqueror
from Egypt and the East, extended to all parts
of Christian Spain, and was particularly used in
convents. These gratings, identical in form and
workmanship with those of Cairo,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> were attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to projecting windows, so that the women of a
household could look into the street without
themselves being seen, a custom which the Spanish
woman still recalls to us by peering, for hours at
a time, between the lowered <i>persiana</i> of her
balcony.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> By the seventeenth century, which
may truthfully be called the age of Spanish
jealousy, and when the &ldquo;Othello-like revenge of
the Moor&rdquo; had eaten into the very entrails of
society, the <i>celosía</i> had become as indispensable
to houses as the door or window. &ldquo;La,&rdquo; wrote
Bertaut de Rouen of a residence on the outskirts
of Madrid, and obviously alluding to these
gratings, &ldquo;il y avoit bien des Dames dans l'appartement
d'enhaut qui y demeurerent cachées, se
contentant de nous voir promener dans le jardin
par les fenêtres.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We know from the stone coat of arms which
is carved above the doorway of the &ldquo;House of
Castril at Granada&rdquo; that in the olden time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
balconies of the Hall of Comares in the Alhambra
were fitted with projecting wooden <i>celosías</i>; and
Contreras says that in the Torre de los Puñales
of the same palace there used to be &ldquo;a kind of
wooden <i>mirador</i> or <i>menacir</i>, covered with <i>celosías</i>
like those of Cairo, and many of which were still
to be seen in Granada early in the nineteenth
century.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am not aware of any Moorish <i>celosía</i> remaining
to this day outside a Spanish building. In
such exposed positions weather and the natural
delicacy of the woodwork seem to have destroyed
them all. As an interior ornament, a single one
(Pl. <a href="#img_42.jpg">xvi</a>.) exists in the Alhambra. Nevertheless,
I hesitate to call this <i>celosía</i> purely Moorish.
Perhaps it is the work of a Morisco, or even of
a Christian-Spaniard, for we know that decorative
wooden fittings for the Alhambra were made in
the sixteenth century by Antonio Navarro and
other craftsmen. The grating, which is well preserved,
covers a window over the archway leading
from the Hall of the Two Sisters into the Sala
de los Ajimeces and the Mirador de Daraxa, and
consists of minute prisms and turned pieces in
the typical Egyptian style.</p>

<p>Other fittings for a building, wrought in wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
by Moorish artists and by these communicated
to the Christian-Spaniards, were balustrades and
cornices, <i>aleros</i> (decorative bands beneath the
eaves of a roof, Plate <a href="#img_44.jpg">xvii</a>.) and <i>zapatas</i> (gargoyle-looking
figures, often in human form, used to
support a roof or gallery). In the so-called &ldquo;Patio
de las Asas&rdquo; of the convent of Santa Catalina de
Zafra, at Granada, exists an interesting Moorish
balustrade<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> that seems almost untouched by time.
I reproduce an outline of it as the tailpiece to the
present chapter, and am glad to append the little
sketch in question, copied from a photograph I
took upon the spot three years ago, because it
is almost impossible to obtain admission to this
convent. Beautiful or uncouth and quaint <i>zapatas</i>
may be seen in the Casa de los Tiros at Granada,
and in many other places (Plates <a href="#img_46.jpg">xviii</a>. and <a href="#img_48.jpg">xix</a>.).
Much of the Moorish woodwork of the palace of
the Alhambra was destroyed by the fire of 1590,
but there yet remain the ample cornice and carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<i>alero</i> of the façade of the Cuarto de Comares
(Plate <a href="#img_50.jpg">xx</a>.), which is often called in error the
Court of the Mezquita. This <i>alero</i> bears the
following inscription, allusive to the Sultan Mohammed
the Fifth:&mdash;&ldquo;I am the place where the
crown is guarded, and on my doors being opened
the regions of the west believe the east to be contained
within me. Algami Billah charged me to
keep guard upon the doorway.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>SACRED STATUARY, <i>SILLERÍAS</i> OR CHOIR-STALLS, AND <i>RETABLOS</i></h3>

<p>The genius of the wood-carvers of older Spain
is manifested chiefly in three groups of objects&mdash;sacred
statuary, choir-stalls, and <i>retablos</i>. Among
this people, and probably by reason of its cheapness,
plain, or gilt, or polychrome painted wood has
always been a favourite material for the statues
of their temples, whether such statues were employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
alone, or as an accessory to a larger article
of sacred furniture, such as a pulpit, or a <i>sillería</i>,
or an altar-screen. So powerful, in fact, has been
the vogue of this material here,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that even to-day
the Spanish people, making, in Symonds' happy
phrase, &ldquo;representation an object in itself, independently
of its spiritual significance,&rdquo; attempt to
elevate the most remarkable of their wooden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and by preference their coloured wooden, statuary
(typically defended by Pacheco's indigested tome),
to rank beside the noblest and the purest monuments
of bronze and marble; denoting, by this
reckless and uneducated partiality, a positively
national misconception of the true domain of art.</p>

<p>It is outside the scope of such a work as this
to deal at any length with Spanish figure-sculpture.
However, it is only fair to recognize that
Spain produced a couple of score or so of admirable
carvers of wood-statuary. Among the
greatest of these craftsmen or <i>imagineros</i> were
Becerra, Berruguete, Juan de Juni, author of the
<i>Mater Dolorosa</i> (&ldquo;Our Lady of the Knives&rdquo;), of
Valladolid; Gregorio Hernández the Galician,
author of &ldquo;Simon the Cyrenian,&rdquo; &ldquo;Santa
Veronica,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Baptism of our Lord&rdquo;;
Martínez Montañes, author of &ldquo;San Jerónimo&rdquo;
and of the &ldquo;Cristo del Gran Poder&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Solis,
Gaspar de Ribas, Juan Gómez, author of the
&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; of Puerto de Santa Maria; Pedro
Roldan, with whom, according to Tubino, &ldquo;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
art of Seville closed its eyes&rdquo;; and Alonso Cano,
master of Pedro and Alonso de Mena, Ruiz del
Peral, José de Mora, and Diego de Mora, and who
carved the exquisite &ldquo;Elijah Sleeping&rdquo; (Pl. <a href="#img_52.jpg">xxi</a>.)
now at Toledo, and also (as it is believed) the
famous statuette (Frontispiece to the present
volume) of Saint Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>The earliest centre of this branch of wood-carving
was Valladolid, where lived and laboured
Juni and Hernández. Nevertheless, although so
popular in every part of Spain, it had a short-lived
prime, originating in the two Castiles towards
the reign of Philip the Second, declining
steadily (with Seville for its centre now) all
through the seventeenth century, and flickering
out, despite the perseverance and the genius of
the Murcian Susillo, in the century succeeding.</p>

<p>In decorative <i>sillerías</i> or sets of choir-stalls,
Spain has produced examples worthy to be set
beside the masterpiece of Vitry in the abbey of
Sainte-Claude, the best productions of Dürer and
his followers in Germany, or those of Donatello,
Brunelleschi, Valdambrino, Vechietta, and Verrochio
in Italy. Nevertheless, her most distinguished
<i>sillería</i>-makers were at almost every
moment inspired and directed by the foreigner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Germans or Flemings were her first preceptors in
this craft. These artists had been sent for, or
proceeded of their own accord, to Spain, and
settling in this country rapidly spread the technics
of their art among the Spaniards. In the
Peninsula the origin of this school or movement
may be traced to Burgos. Here, just as the
fifteenth century was drawing to its close, and just
before the breath of the Renaissance crossed the
Spanish frontier at its eastern side, was gathered
a small though influential group of eminent
workers in more crafts than one; painters and
sculptors, architects, embroiderers, carvers of
wood, <i>reja</i>-makers, and painters of cathedral glass.
Prominent among them all was a foreigner
named Philip Vigarny,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who is described by
Diego de Sagrado as &ldquo;singular above all others
in the art of making statuary and sculpture;
a man of vast experience, general in his mastery
of the liberal and mechanic arts, and no less
resolute in all that is related with the sciences
of architecture.&rdquo;</p>

have no tidings. In documents which bear
his signature he styles himself &ldquo;<i>imaginario</i>,

exist. On August 1st, 1505, he agrees, for 130,000
<i>maravedis</i>, to make &ldquo;such images as may be
necessary&rdquo; for the altar of the high chapel of
Palencia cathedral, &ldquo;he with his own hand to
carve the hands and faces, out of good smooth
walnut, without painting.&rdquo; This document is
dated from Palencia. The other two are dated
severally, Burgos, December 6th, 1506, and

the year.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> We also know this craftsman to have
made the great <i>retablo</i> of Burgos cathedral.
Such, from the fragmentary semblance we can
trace of him, was Philip Vigarny, the pioneer
of the wood-carvers of older Spain, and who,
aided by other craftsmen from abroad, communicated
all the secrets of his art to Spaniards such
as Gil de Siloe, Ruy Sanchez, Diego de la Cruz,
Alonso de Lima, and Berruguete.</p>

<p>The typical <i>sillería</i> consists of two tiers; the
<i>sellia</i> or upper seats, with high backs and a canopy,
intended for the canons, and the lower seats or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<i>subsellia</i>, of simpler pattern and with lower backs,
intended for the <i>beneficiados</i>. At the head of all
is placed the presidential throne, larger than the
other stalls, and covered, in many cases, by a
canopy surmounted by a tall spire. When the
<i>sillería</i> belongs to a monastery, the higher stalls
are for the <i>profesos</i>, and the lower for the novices
and <i>legos</i>. Commonly the part that forms the
actual seat is hinged and rises to a vertical position,
being so contrived that when the occupant rises
to his feet, there remains a narrow ledge projecting
from the under surface. This ledge is called the
&ldquo;seat of pity&rdquo; or &ldquo;of patience,&rdquo; because the
worshipper is able to incline himself on it and
give his limbs some measure of repose without
appearing to be seated. There also is commonly
another piece, intended for him to rest his hands
upon in rising, which projects from the sides
of the stall and forms a part of the decorative
carving, as well as, somewhat higher still, the
carved support to rest his arms while he is on
his feet.</p>

<p>The earliest Spanish <i>sillerías</i> date from the
fourteenth century; but it is not until the century
succeeding that we find them at their very best.
Gothic or Plateresco <i>sillerías</i> of marvellous design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and workmanship are those of the Seo of Zaragoza
(begun in 1412), the Cartuja de Miraflores of
Burgos (1489), the monastery of Oña, Santa
María de Nájera (1495), the church of Santa
María del Campo, in the province of Burgos,
Santo Tomás of Avila (finished in 1493), and the
cathedrals of Oviedo, Segovia (1461&ndash;1497),
Ciudad Rodrigo, Tarragona (1478), Tarazona,
Toledo (begun in 1494), Zamora, Astorga,
Barcelona (1453&ndash;1483), and Seville (finished
in 1478).</p>

<p>The Gothic choir-stalls of the Seo of Zaragoza
have lofty backs with arabesque Mudejar ornamentation,
small Gothic columns, and medallions
containing figures upon the arms of every stall.
The material is Flemish oak. The carving
was begun in 1412 by the Moors Alí Arrondi,
Muza, and Chamar, who earned a daily wage
of four <i>sueldos</i>. In 1446 Juan Navarro and the
brothers Antonio and Francisco Gomar were
working at the same stalls, and also, in 1449,
Francoy.</p>

<p>The stalls of the Cartuja de Miraflores at
Burgos were carved by Martin Sánchez, who
received in 1486, and for the <i>mano de obra</i> alone,
the sum of 125,000 <i>maravedis</i>. The material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which was presented by Luis de Velasco, Señor of
Belorado, is dark walnut.</p>

<p>The <i>sillería</i> of Santa María de Nájera, the
work of Maestro Andrés and Maestro Nicolás,
is Gothic merging into the Renaissance. That
of Santo Tomás of Avila (late Gothic) consists
of sixty oaken stalls, besides two larger ones
resembling thrones (Plate <a href="#img_58.jpg">xxiv</a>.), intended to be
occupied by Ferdinand and Isabella, founders
of this monastery, and whose arms they bear in
lace-like carving. The rest of the decoration is
composed of thistles, vines, trefoils, and pomegranates.
Owing to the fact that not a single
cross appears on any part of the <i>sillería</i> (although
this circumstance is not unusual in sacred Gothic
woodwork), there is a superstition that these stalls
were wrought anonymously by some Jew, condemned
to execute them by the Inquisition as
a form of punishment. This fable has no
value. Although the author's name is not upon
the stalls, they are identical in nearly every
detail with those of the Cartuja de Miraflores
at Burgos, known to have been carved by Martin
Sánchez in 1486. Hence it is extremely probable
that this craftsman was the author of both
<i>sillerías</i>.</p>

<p>On many Spanish <i>sillerías</i> we find most spirited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
reproductions of the life and manners of their
time; satirical allusions to contemporary vices,
allegories and caprices as fantastic, in the phrase
of Vargas Ponce, as &ldquo;one of Bosch's nightmares,&rdquo;
hunting-scenes or love-scenes, banquets, tournaments,
dances, battles, sieges, and even bull-fights.
Thus, on the stalls of the cathedrals of Zamora,
Oviedo, Plasencia, Astorga, and León are carved
such subjects as the following. A fox dressed as
a friar, preaching to a group of hens but slyly
abstracting their chicks (Zamora), men fighting
with their fists (Zamora), a hog playing the
bagpipes (León), the Devil in the garb of a
confessor, tempting a penitent (León), a woman
suckling an ass (León), a man armed with a
lance, fighting a woman (Astorga), a bird of prey
struggling with a crocodile (Astorga), card-players
(Astorga), a warrior on all-fours, whipped by a
woman (Plasencia), an <i>auto-de-fé</i> (Plasencia),
swine praying and spinning (Ciudad Rodrigo),
a fight between a tiger and a bull (Ciudad
Rodrigo), a monkey beating a drum (Ciudad
Rodrigo), and a monkey wearing a mitre (Ciudad
Rodrigo).</p>

<p>The style of the lower stalls of Toledo cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is good Plateresque. They were begun in 1494
by Maese Rodrigo, one of the very best of Spain's
<i>entalladores</i>, and portray, in each successive stall,
the phases of the last campaign against Granada
(Plate <a href="#img_60.jpg">xxv</a>.); the sieges or battles of Altora, Melis,
Xornas, Erefran, Alminia, Baza, Málaga (two
stalls), Salobreña, Almuñecar, Comares, Beles,
Montefrío, Moclín, Illora, Loja, Cazarabonela,

subsequently.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>sillería</i> of Barcelona cathedral was begun
in the middle of the fifteenth century by Matias
Bonafé, at the same time that the German
Michael Locher and his pupil John Frederic
worked at the canopies. It was finished thirty
years later. Upon the back (which otherwise is
plain) of every stall is a coat of arms distinct from
all its neighbours, marking the seat of one of
the princes or nobles summoned by Charles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Fifth to the Chapter of the Order of the Golden
Fleece, March 5th, 1519.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The splendid <i>sillería</i> of Seville cathedral is a
mingling of the Gothic with the Mudejar and
Plateresque. The material is oak and fir, and
the number of the seats one hundred and seventeen.
The <i>sellia</i> are surmounted by a graceful
running <i>guardapolvo</i>. Each seat is carved distinctly
from the rest, and further decorated in the
Mudejar style with inlaid woods of various kinds
and colours, imitating stone mosaic. Among
this labyrinth of design are groups of people,
angels, animals, and scenes from Scripture, as
well as, on the lower stalls, the Giralda tower,
which forms the arms of the cathedral. The
<i>sillería</i> is further embellished with two hundred
and sixteen statuettes, seventy-two of which are
ranged along the canopy or <i>dosel</i>, the remainder
being distributed between the seats.</p>

<p>The authors of this splendid work of art
(judiciously restored some years ago by Boutelou,
Fernandez, and Mattoni) were Nufio Sanchez,
Dancart, and several other craftsmen, concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
whom we know but very little. Sánchez'
name is carved upon the second stall of the
upper row, and on the side of the Evangelist,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>With the dawn of the sixteenth century, the
Gothic style runs rapidly into that of the Renaissance.
At about this time, and as Baron Davillier
pointed out, we sometimes find a triple influence,
namely, the Burgundian, the Italian, and the native
Spanish. Vigarny may be called the champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the first of these, Berruguete (who studied in
Italy) of the second, and Guillermo Doncel of the
third. After this the purer Renaissance gives
place to the decadent, as in the stalls of Santiago,
Málaga, Cordova, and Salamanca.</p>

<p>Sixteenth-century <i>sillerías</i> of note are those of
Burgos cathedral (Plate <a href="#img_62.jpg">xxvi</a>.), carved by Vigarny,
Avila cathedral, the Pilar of Zaragoza, the Minor
Friars of the Cartuja of Burgos, Pamplona cathedral,
San Marcos of León, Huesca, the <i>alta
sillería</i> of Toledo, and the walnut stalls&mdash;carved
in 1526 by Bartolomé Fernandez de Segovia,
and now in the Madrid Museum&mdash;of the Parral
of Segovia.</p>

<p>The <i>sillería</i> of Avila cathedral is believed to
have been begun in 1527 by Juan Rodrigo,
although the greater part of it was probably
executed between 1536 and 1547 by Cornelis de
Holanda, who took for his model the stalls of
San Benito of Valladolid. The cost of the walnut
wood and of its workmanship amounted to 33,669
<i>reales</i>.</p>

<p>The upper stalls of Toledo cathedral were
carved by Vigarny and Alonso Berruguete in
collaboration, so that we find in them the northern
and Italian styles effectively and interestingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
united. The Plateresque-Renaissance <i>sillería</i>,
described as &ldquo;genuinely Spanish,&rdquo; of the old convent
of San Marcos of León, containing statuettes
of biblical personages and of fathers of the
Church&mdash;Saint Isidore among them,&mdash;was finished
in 1542 by Guillermo Doncel, who added the
inscription &ldquo;<i>Magister Guillermus Doncel me fecit
MDXLII</i>&rdquo; (Plate <a href="#img_64.jpg">xxvii</a>.). We know, however,
nothing more about this excellent Spanish artist,
except that (on the unsupported testimony of
Cean) he worked at the façade of this convent
between the years 1537 and 1544.</p>

</div>

<p>The intricate <i>sillería</i> of the Pilar of Zaragoza,
containing almost every kind of subject&mdash;beasts,
birds and fishes, allegories, incidents of the chase,
or scenes of popular life&mdash;was designed by Esteban
de Obray, a Navarrese, and executed by him and
his assistants, Juan Moreto Florentino and Nicolas
de Lobato, between 1542 and 1548. That of the
Minor Friars of the Cartuja of Burgos was carved
at a cost of eight hundred and ten ducats by
Simón de Bueras, in 1558. That of Pamplona
cathedral dates from about the middle of the century,
and is the work of one Ancheta, who had
visited Italy and gathered inspiration from the
masterpieces of Siena. The material is English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
oak. The stalls of Huesca, carved from oak proceeding
from an older <i>sillería</i> which had been
removed, were begun in 1587 and finished in
1594. The craftsmen were Nicolás de Verástegui
and Juan Verrueta de Sangüesa.</p>

<p>Seventeenth-century <i>sillerías</i> are those of
Santiago, carved by Juan de Vila in 1603; Salamanca,
in 1651, by Alfonso Balbás; Orihuela, in
1692, by Juan Bautista Borja; and Segorbe,
carved in the same year by Nicolás Camarón;
while dating from the eighteenth century&mdash;a
period of manifest decadence in this beautiful but
short-lived craft&mdash;are the stalls of Lerida, by Luis
Bonifar y Masó (born in 1730), and Cordova,
executed between 1748 and 1757, at a cost of
913,889 <i>reales</i>, by Pedro Ciriaco Duque y Cornejo,
a son of Seville and a pupil of the Sevillano
Roldan.</p>

<p>The least imperfect of these later and decadent
<i>sillerías</i> is that of Málaga, whose author, Pedro
de Mena, was, like his master, Alonso Cano, a
native of Granada.</p>

<p>Mena's contract with two canons of the cathedral,
nominated by the bishop to prepare and sign
the stipulations, will be found in No. 134 of the
<i>Boletín de la Sociedad de Excursiones</i>.</p>

<p>The stalls of Málaga number a hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
one, carved in walnut, larch, cedar, and the heavy
Indian wood called <i>granadillo</i>. As happens with
many of the <i>sillerías</i> of this country, the costumes
of the figures are of great historical value.
Among the saints is San Roque, in pilgrim's
garb, attended by the dog who brought him day
by day a loaf of bread while men refused to
succour him.</p>

<p>No less magnificent than these sets of choir-stalls
are the carved <i>retablos</i> or altar-screens,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a
gradual excrescence from the primitive and unpretentious
altar of the early days of Christianity.
Several kinds of craftsmen worked upon these
altar-screens, such as <i>tallistas</i>, <i>entalladores</i>, <i>imagineros</i>,
and even architects.</p>

<p class="caption">XXXVI<br />DETAIL OF <i>RETABLO</i><br />
(<i>Chapel of Santa Ana, Burgos Cathedral</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The Golden Age of the <i>retablo</i> embraces the
end of the fifteenth century and the whole of the
sixteenth. Notable examples belonging to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
period are the screens of the monastery of Santo
Tomás at Avila, San Martin of Segovia, the
Cartuja de Miraflores, the Colegiata of Covarrubias
in the province of Burgos, the cathedrals
of Avila, Toledo, Tudela, and Tarazona; several
in the churches of Toledo, two in the church of
San Lesmes (Burgos), two in Burgos Cathedral
(Plate <a href="#img_82.jpg">xxxvi</a>.), and three, including those of <i>Reyes</i>
and of <i>Buena Mariana</i>, in the church of San Gil
in the same city. Not one of these, however,
has the grandeur or variety of the altar-screen
of Seville (Plates <a href="#img_76.jpg">xxxiii</a>. and <a href="#img_79.jpg">xxxiv</a>.), which is
carefully described in Cean's monograph. &ldquo;The
style is Gothic; the material, undecaying larch;
and the screen, which reaches nearly to the
vaulting, is the largest in the country, although
at first it spanned the presbytery only, not
including either side. It was designed in 1482
by Dancat or Danchart, who began work upon
it as soon as his sketches were approved, and
worked at it till 1492, in which year he seems to
have died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dancat was succeeded by Master Marco and
Bernardo de Ortega, whose carving reached, by
1505, the canopy or <i>viga</i>, and who were followed
in their turn by Francisco, Bernardo's son, father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and teacher of Bernardino and Nufrio de Ortega,
his assistants. Some of the statues were carved
by Micer Domingo. The rest of the <i>imaginería</i>
was finished in 1526; and the gilding and painting
were done by Alejo Fernández, his brother, and
Andrés de Covarrubias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the screen remained till 1550, when the
Chapter decided to extend it, without altering the
style of decoration, to the sides of the presbytery.
By this time Spanish sculpture had improved,
and many of our best-known sculptors lent their
aid, of whom the earliest were Roque Balduc,
Pedro Becerril, el Castellano, Juan de Villalva,
Diego Vazquez, and Pedro Bernal. In 1553 the
Chapter appointed, to inspect the work of these
artists, Juan Reclid and Luis de Aguilar, both of
whom lived at Jaen. Henceforth the master-craftsmen
working at the screen were Pedro de
Heredia, Gomez de Orozco, Diego Vazquez the
younger, Juan Lopez, Andrés Lopez del Castillo,
and his sons, Juan de Palencia, and Juan Bautista
Vazquez. By 1564 the screen was quite concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Gothic work is of incomparable richness.
Ten groups of tall and narrow columns, resting
upon two pedestals or socles, divide the <i>retablo</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
into nine spaces, crossed by horizontal bands of
complicated carving, forming a series of thirty-six
niches, in four rows. Statues a little less
than life-size represent, in the first row, the creation
and fall of our first parents, and the mysteries
of the infancy of Christ; in the second, His preaching
and miracles; in the third, His passion and
death; and in the fourth, His resurrection, appearance
to the disciples, and ascension; also the
coming of the Holy Ghost. Upon the altar-table,
and resting in its niche, is the statue, covered
with silver plates, of Nuestra Señora de la Sede,
presented to this temple by Saint Ferdinand.
Above the <i>viga</i>, which has an <i>artesonado</i> ceiling,
rises a frontispiece containing thirteen canopied
niches with statues of the apostles, and in the
centre niche that of the Virgin Mary. Crowning
the whole <i>retablo</i> are statues larger than life-size,
and a Calvary standing in free space.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Throughout these Spanish altar-screens the
influence which predominates is that of Germany.
They are essentially distinguished by a Northern art
(Plates <a href="#img_80.jpg">xxxv</a>., <a href="#img_82.jpg">xxxvi</a>.), not sentimental but material,
not tender but robust, not (like the art of the
Italians) retrospective or prospective, but prosaic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
realistic, actual. Curiously enough, their presence
seems incongruous in Spain, and yet they made
themselves at home here; for Spanish art was ever
realistic, so probably on this account two widely
different nations found, at least in this particular
craft, a common bond of sympathy. Certainly the
Renaissance, while it seemed to cherish and encourage,
really undermined and killed this branch of
Spanish wood-carving. A similar phenomenon
attends the art of the Alhambra. In either case
the plenitude of power and of beauty is even more
ephemeral than the term of human life; and thus,
deluded by so brilliant and majestic a decay, we
fail to apprehend, or seek to grow oblivious of,
the imminence of their ruin.</p>

Spanish bed is bewildering. We find in common use the canopy
(<i>almocalla</i>, <i>almuzala</i>; Arabic, <i>al-mokalla</i>, i.e. &ldquo;haven of refuge in
all winds&rdquo;&mdash;not always, possibly, a judicious term in the case of a
<i>cama de matrimonio</i> or &ldquo;marriage-bed&rdquo;); the cloth-lined skins for
chilly weather (<i>alifafe</i>, <i>alifad</i>; Arabic <i>al-lifafh</i>), such as King Juan
the First of Aragon provided for his daughter (&ldquo;two leathers of
Morocco for the bed.&rdquo; <i>Archive of the Crown of Aragon;
Registro 1906, fol. 42</i>); the parament or <i>dosal</i>; the <i>galnapé</i> or
topmost of the bedclothes proper (&ldquo;<i>un lecho con guenabe</i>&rdquo;; Fuero
of Cáceres, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1229); the counterpane (<i>fatel</i>, <i>fatol</i>, <i>alfatel</i>, <i>facel</i>,
<i>farele</i>, <i>fateye</i>, <i>fatiro</i>; Arabic <i>fatla</i>); the linen sheets (<i>izares</i>, <i>lentros</i>,
<i>lentos</i>, <i>lintes</i>, <i>lincas</i>, <i>linteáminas</i>, or <i>lencios</i>); and the mattress,
pillow, and bolster, called, all three of them, <i>plumazo</i>, <i>plumario</i>, or
<i>plumaco</i>. Nearly or quite identical in meaning with these last are
<i>cúlcita</i> and <i>almadraque</i>. <i>Cúlcita</i> is corrupted into <i>colcedra</i>, <i>cocedra</i>,
<i>conzara</i>, <i>colotra</i>, and other more or less barbaric variations; while
<i>almohada</i>, <i>almuella</i>, <i>travesera</i>, <i>almofadinha</i>, <i>faseruelo</i>, and <i>aljamar</i>
also signify a pillow or a cushion.</p></div>

the tapestried or other decorative cloths displayed in Spain on gala
days from balconies of public edifices, or the mansions of the
aristocracy; but dictionaries which were printed at the close of the

will be described a little later on. As to the use of decorated leather
by the Moors, in the small chamber of the Alhambra opening into
the Mirador of Daraxa, and known as the Sala de los Ajimeces, is
a bare space about nine feet in height, which runs the whole way
round beneath the copious ornament of the remainder of the wall.
Contreras says that the Moorish sultans used to hang these spaces
with decorated leathers, tapestry, and armour. Sometimes the
tapestry or leather would be worked or painted with hunting-scenes
(<i>tardwahsh</i>&mdash;the chase of the lion, panther, or wild boar), or even
with portraits of the sultans. Among these latter is the celebrated
painting on the ceiling of the Hall of Justice, executed, as are its
companions at each side of it, upon a leather groundwork with a
plaster coating.</p></div>

pewter trash for sterling gold and silver coin&mdash;from being imposed
upon by manufacturers and merchants. But the power of discriminating
between a genuine or well-made object and a piece of
counterfeit or worthless rubbish is, among all peoples, better sought
for and developed by experience than by legislation; and there was
something noxiously prosaic in a code of city ordinances which
forbade the craftsman to prepare his own design, or choose his
own material, or establish his own prices. How violently, or at
least how primitively, hostile to the sense of art must not have been
these Christian sons of Spain to need&mdash;or think they needed&mdash;so
impertinent and tyrannous a system of protection!</p></div>

by surrounding it with arches wrought of leather in relief and
superposed on leather. As a rule the arches were gilt and silvered,
and rested upon pilasters or columns. When pilasters were used,
their centres would be ornamented with Italian devices such as
flowers, trophies, imitated cameos, and foliage. Landscapes with a
far horizon and no figures, known as <i>boscaje</i> or <i>pintura verde</i> were
painted on the space between the arches, so that the general effect
was that of a pavilion with arches on all sides, displaying everywhere
a wide expanse of fertile country. The arches rested on a
broad bordering of <i>guadamecíes</i>, and running round the lower part
was a <i>zócalo</i> or socle, commonly made of tiling.</p>

Ramírez de Arellano has found and published a notice relative to
Lope de Liaño and García Alonso, two artificers of this city who
signed, on January 7th, 1572, a contract with the prior of the monastery
of the Holy Martyrs to build a ceiling for one of the chapels
of the same. The document, which is quoted <i>in extenso</i> in the
<i>Boletín de la Sociedad Española de Excursiones</i> for November,
1900, abounds in technical expressions, many of them partly or
entirely Moorish.</p>

<p>The same writer publishes the names (hitherto completely unrecorded)
of thirteen other artist-carpenters who worked at Cordova
in the latter half of the sixteenth century and early in the seventeenth.
The craft, in fact, died hard, and ceilings of this kind,
replete with Moorish detail, were made in certain parts of Southern
Spain until the closing moments of the eighteenth century.</p></div>

Nuestra Señora del Pilar at Zaragoza, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;On y void quantité
de lampes d'argent et on m'en raconta un miracle qu'il me
fut impossible de ne pas croire. C'est d'un pauvre homme qui
ayant eu la jambe coupée pour une blessure, et s'estant bien recommandé
à <i>Nostra Señora del Pilar</i>, il se trouva un jour avec sa mesme
jambe qu'il avoit déja fait enterrer. Y'ay sceu l'histoire du chirurgien
mesme qui coupa cette jambe et de quantité de témoins de veuë.
Il n'y a que quinze ans que cela est arrivé, mais l'homme est mort
depuis peu.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Journal du Voyage en Espagne</i>, p. 203.</p></div>

<h2><a name="IVORIES" id="IVORIES">IVORIES</a></h2>

<p>The story of Spanish ivory-work is shortly told,
for probably no craft, excepting glass, has been so
little practised in this country. The older Spanish
writers rarely mention it, although from time to
time this substance may have been employed for
carving diptyches and boxes, and Roderick is
stated to have entered the battle of the Guadalete
in an ivory car, by which is meant, perhaps, a
chariot of Byzantine make or pattern, covered
with ivory plates. However, properly speaking,
the history of this art as exercised in Spain begins
in the eleventh century, attains its prime towards
the fourteenth century, and ceases altogether at
the time of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Among the ivory objects now preserved in
Spain, and which were wrought by artists other
than Mohammedan, none is more interesting or
important than the consular diptych of Oviedo
cathedral. Although this valuable diptych was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
not made in Spain, but manifests Byzantine art in
all its purity, it well deserves to be described. It
consists of two ivory tablets measuring sixteen
inches and a half in height by twelve inches and a
half across both leaves. Each leaf has a simple
border of a triple form, and just inside each corner
is a circular floral ornament in relief, with a lion's
head in the centre. Another ornament, also circular,
is in the centre of each leaf, and contains,
carved within a graceful S-shaped border, a half-length
portrait of the Consul, who is represented
in the act of throwing down into the amphitheatre
his <i>mappa</i> or handkerchief<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> with his right hand,
while in his left he holds the sceptre (<i>scipio imaginifer</i>),
crowned with a small bust. His hair is
curled in the Byzantine fashion, and his costume
is a richly decorated toga.</p>

<p>An inscription runs along the top of either
tablet, between the border and the circular devices
carved with flowers. It says:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Flavius Strategius Apion&mdash;Strategius Apion.
Vir inlustris Comes Devotissimorum Domesticorum
et Consul ordinarius.</i></p>

<p class="caption">XXXVII<br />IVORY BOX<br />
(<i>9th Century. Madrid Museum</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>We gather, therefore, that this magnate was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
chamberlain at court, as well as ordinary consul.</p>

<p>Diptyches were used among the Romans for all
kinds of purposes, such as to convey love-messages,
as invitations to a banquet, or to notify the celebration
of feasts and games. We find the diptych
also used in Christian temples from the time of
Constantine, serving to record church festivals or
names of saints and martyrs, as covers for a copy
of the gospel (<i>diptycha evangeliorum</i>), or as reliquaries
(<i>thecae reliquiarum</i>). Sometimes these
diptyches were wrought expressly for the church,
or sometimes they were consular diptyches that
had been preserved from former ages. This latter
class, when cleansed from pagan usage and devoted
to the ceremonies of the Christian faith, was
known as <i>diptycha mixta</i>.</p>

<p>Such early objects as were wrought in ivory by
Spanish hands, consisting as a rule of circular or
oblong, square or oval caskets, were principally
carved by Moors or Mudejares. Among the
Spanish-Moorish boxes which are still preserved
are several of the greatest interest and beauty
(Plates <a href="#img_92.jpg">xxxviii</a>., <a href="#img_94.jpg">xxxix</a>., <a href="#img_96.jpg">xl</a>.). One of them, made
from pieces of an older casket believed to date
from earlier than the Moorish conquest, is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the National Museum. The decoration in its
present form consists of Arabic inscriptions in
relief, together with figures of the apostles. This
casket, which proceeds from the Colegiata of Saint
Isidore at León, measures seven inches in length
by five in depth and six in height, and has been
used as a reliquary.</p>

<p>Another, dating from the middle of the eleventh
century and proceeding from the same temple as
the one just noticed, is also in the National
Museum. It was a present from the Emir Mohammed
Almotamid-Aben-Abed to his second
wife, Al-Badir (&ldquo;the Moon&rdquo;), and includes among
the decoration dogs and doves, symbolic of affection
and fidelity. The style of carving is what is
known as Persian-Arabic. We do not know,
however, whether the box was imported from the
East, or whether it was made in Spain by somebody
of Persian parentage or skilled in Persian
art. The material is a delicate <i>taracea</i> of sandal,
aloe, and cypress woods inlaid on larch. The
box, which was used at León as a reliquary, has
bronze clasps, and is inscribed along the top with
sentences from which we learn that it was made
by Aben-As-Serag.</p>

</div>

<p>In the cathedral of Pamplona is a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ivory box (Plate <a href="#img_92.jpg">xxxviii</a>.) which was originally at
Sangüesa in Navarre. It measures, says Riaño,
fifteen inches long by nine and a quarter inches
wide. &ldquo;It is completely covered with carvings
in relief, within circular cusped medallions, with
figures in the centres representing different
subjects; men seated, hawking, or struggling
with wild beasts, and numerous single figures of
lions, stags, and other animals. The intermediate
spaces contain an ornamentation of leaves and
flowers which is accommodated to the geometrical
style of Saracenic art. Round the upper part of
this box appears an Arabic inscription in fine
Cufic characters:&mdash;&lsquo;In the name of God. The
blessing of God, the complete felicity, the happiness,
the fulfilment of the hope of good works,
and the adjourning the fatal period (of death), be
with the Hagib Seifo daula (sword of the State),
Abdelmalek ben Almansur. This (box) was made
by the orders (of the said Hagib), under the inspection
or direction of his chief eunuch, Nomayr
ben Mohammad Alaumeri, his slave, in the year
of 395 (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1005).&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the centre medallion, on the opposite side
to the lock, is represented the standing figure of
a man who is attacked by two lions. He holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on his arm a shield, upon which is engraved an
inscription, with the following religious formula:
&lsquo;There is no god but God,&rsquo; or a similar one,
for the characters are very illegible and confused.
In the centre of this shield may be read the words,
&lsquo;Made by Hair,&rsquo; undoubtedly one of the artists
who made the box. Another artist's name may
be read with difficulty in a similar inscription
which appears on one of the medallions on the
left side; it is written on the thigh of a stag,
which is attacked by a lion: &lsquo;It was made by
Obeidat.&rsquo; Three other inscriptions of a similar
character appear in other parts of this box, which
probably give the names of other artists, but I
have been unable to decipher them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other interesting boxes dating from the same
period are that of Santo Domingo de Silos at
Burgos, and several which are in the National
Museum at Madrid. The box which is preserved
at Burgos is made of ivory, and measures thirteen
inches and a quarter in length by seven inches
and a half in width and height. The decorative
work consists of hunting scenes, and also of an
inscription in Cufic characters which says: &ldquo;Permanent
felicity for the owner (of this box). May
God lengthen his days. It was made at Medina &hellip;;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in the year four hundred and seventeen (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1025). It is the work of his servant Mohammed-ibn-Zeiyan.
May God glorify him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is also in the provincial museum of
Burgos a handsome ivory diptych which was
formerly at the convent of Santo Domingo de
Silos. It bears at each extremity&mdash;that is, four
times repeated&mdash;the following inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;This
was ordered to be made by the Iman, servant
of God, Abd-er-Rhaman, prince of believers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the rectangular boxes in the National
Museum is one of carved ivory, with an inscription
recording it to have been a gift from Prince Ali
to one of the favourites of his harem, and another
of the same material which was once upon a time
at Carrion de los Condes, in the province of
Palencia. This box is painted with a decorative
pattern in carmine and dark green. The lid,
which is imperfect, contains the following inscription
in Cufic characters, standing boldly out
against a green ground:&mdash;&ldquo;In the name of
Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate. The
protection of Allah and an impending victory
for the servant of Allah &hellip;; and his wali Maad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Abu-Temim&mdash;the Iman Al-Moez &hellip;; prince of
believers (the blessing of Allah be upon him
and his sons the good). (This) was commanded
to be made for (celebrating) the fortunate
victory. It was made by &hellip;; Jorasani.&rdquo; The
length of this box is eighteen inches, and its
height nine inches.</p>

<p>A fine Moorish box (Plate <a href="#img_94.jpg">xxxix</a>.), now in the
cathedral of Palencia, is covered with elaborately
engraved and perforated ivory plates upon a
ground of gilt leather backed by wood, and
further ornamented with enamel-work upon a
copper surface. This box is fourteen inches
long, and has a gable top. The decoration
on the sides and lid consists of palm-leaves,
birds, and men engaged in combating and
chasing antelopes and lions in the characteristic
manner of Assyrian art. A lengthy Cufic inscription
tells us that the box was made at Cuenca
(<i>Medina Cuenca</i>) by Abd-er-Rahman ben Ziyan,
to the order of the Moorish princes of Toledo,
and that it dates from the year 441 of the Hegira.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Vives has pointed out that Cuenca was evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a principal centre of this industry, and that
caskets executed here about this time exist in
Perpignan cathedral and in the provincial museum
of Burgos.</p>

<p>Riaño mentions seven ivory boxes of particular
interest, which were probably made in Spain by
Spanish Arabs, or else by Eastern craftsmen
who had emigrated to this country. &ldquo;On all
their carving,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;the names of Spanish
historical persons appear, and it is hardly possible
that they were ordered in remote countries, especially
as some of these objects are small and comparatively
unimportant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two of these boxes are in the South Kensington
Museum. The one which is cylindrical in shape
and has a domed cover is thus described by
Maskell in his <i>Ivories, Ancient and Mediæval,
in the South Kensington Museum</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;This beautiful
box is carved throughout, except the bottom
of it, with interlacing narrow bands forming
quatrefoils, in which, on the cover, are four eagles.
These have spread wings and stand erect; well
designed and most delicately executed. A small
knob serves to lift the lid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Round the side, each quatrefoil is filled with a
star having a leaf ornament. The same decoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is repeated in the spaces between the larger quatrefoils
on the cover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole is carved in pierced work, except a
band which forms the upper upright portion of the
box, round the side of the lid. This band has an
Arabic inscription: &lsquo;A favour of God to the
servant of God, Al Hakem al Mostanser Billah,
commander of the faithful.&rsquo; He was a Caliph
who reigned at Cordova, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 961&ndash;976.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other box is oblong and rectangular.
&ldquo;The cover and sides are carved with scroll
foliated ornament; the hinges and clasp are of
chased silver inlaid with niello. Round the sides,
immediately below the lid, is the following Arabic
inscription in Cufic characters:&mdash;&lsquo;In the name of
God. This (box) was ordered to be made by
Seidat Allah, the wife of Abd-er-Rahman, prince
of the believers. God be merciful and satisfied
with him.&rsquo;&rdquo; This inscription, adds Riaño, &ldquo;must
allude to Abd-er-Rahman the Third, the first
Caliph of Cordova who bore the title of Emir, el
Mumenin. The formula &lsquo;God be merciful,&rsquo; etc.,
denotes that he was dead when it was written.
He died <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 961.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another Spanish-Moorish casket, also at South
Kensington, and dating from the eleventh century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is described by Maskell as &ldquo;richly carved in deep
relief with foliage and animals in scrolls interlacing
one another, and forming larger and smaller
circles. The top and each side is a single plaque
of ivory; the sloping lid at the front and back has
two panels. On the two are two animals, like
doves; a large bird stands at the back of each,
attacking it with his beak. The sloping sides
have, in the large circles, men on horseback, and
animals fighting. The intermediate spaces are
completely filled with foliage, and smaller beasts.
Similar subjects are repeated in the circles on the
panels forming the lower sides of the casket, and
among them are two groups of men and women
sitting; one blowing a horn, another playing on
a guitar, another holding a cup in one hand and a
flower in the other.&rdquo; Riaño adds: &ldquo;There is no
inscription on this casket, but in one of the
medallions on the lid there is a bust, which is
carried on the back of a horse, and which is
probably a representation of the prince for whom
the casket was made.&rdquo;</p>

León, mentions an ivory cross (which will be
noticed presently), an ivory box fitted with gold,
and two ivory boxes fitted with silver, one of
them containing three other silver boxes, similarly
decorated.</p>

<p>One of these boxes is described by Ambrosio
de Morales, and from his words we conclude it
to be the one which was adorned with gold,
&ldquo;of which metal,&rdquo; he wrote in 1572, &ldquo;it has even
more than of ivory,&rdquo; adding that it measured more
than half a yard in length, and enshrined the body
of Saint Vincent of Avila. He also tells us that
it bore the following inscription, carved upon a
golden frieze:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">ARCULA SANCTORUM MICAT HAEC SUB HONORE DUORUM<br />

<p>This <i>arca</i> has been much mutilated, and stripped
of all the precious metal. Morales' description
is therefore of especial value, as are the ivory
tablets (eleventh century), carved with Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>

<p class="caption">XLII<br />BYZANTINE CRUCIFIX</p>
</div>

<p>Dating from the thirteenth century is a Moorish
casket (Plate <a href="#img_96.jpg">xl</a>.), preserved in the Academy
of History at Madrid, and proceeding from
the Carthusian monastery of Val de Cristo at
Segorbe. It measures a foot in length by eight
inches in height and four and a half inches in
depth. The lid is deeply bevelled, and contains
on each of the bevelled sides shields with the
bars which constitute the arms of Aragon, painted
upon a gold ground, together with imperial eagles
painted in black upon a carmine ground. A
decorative device of leaves and stems is also
painted on the ivory.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Amador de los Ríos believes that this
casket was captured in war by Jayme the First
of Aragon, remaining with successive princes of
his line until the reign of Don Martin, by
whom it was presented to the monastery. The
shields would thus be added to the primitive
Moorish casket by some Christian-Spanish
painter.</p>

<p>The ivory crucifix (Plates <a href="#img_98.jpg">xli</a>. and <a href="#img_99.jpg">xli</a>. (<i>a</i>)), of
Ferdinand the First and Doña Sancha, made in
the first half of the eleventh century, and offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
by these sovereigns to the church of Saint John
the Baptist (or of Saint Isidore) at León, measures
twenty-one inches in length by thirteen inches and
a half in height. The figure of Christ recalls the
rigidness and rudeness of Byzantine craftsmanship,
such as is found in ancient crucifixes still
preserved in Spain (Plate <a href="#img_100.jpg">xlii</a>.). The pupils of the
enormous, expressionless eyes are made of jet.
We see the wound upon each foot, with wavy
marks to imitate the flowing blood, but no trace
of a nail. Nails, however, transfix the hands.
The arms are separate from the trunk, but the
<i>suppedaneum</i> on which the feet are resting is of
a single piece with the body of the figure.</p>

<p>The surface of the cross, especially about the
borders, contains elaborate decoration, including
animals and foliage. Above the Saviour's head is
the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">IHS NAZA<br />
RENVS REX<br />
IVDEORVM</p>

<p>Above this is another figure of Christ seated,
crowned with a cruciform nimbus and holding a
Greek processional cross. Beneath the feet of
the larger figure is Adam in an uncouth posture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
turning his head to gaze upward, and at the
lower extremity of the cross are carved the
words:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">FERDINANDVS REX<br />
SANCIA REGINA</p>

<p>The lateral arms are carved with numerous
devices forming an effective whole, including
animals upon a tessellated band which seems to
imitate a groundwork of mosaic. Other subjects
represented are the Resurrection of the Flesh,
the ascent of the blessed to Heaven, and the fall
of the wicked to Hell.</p>

<p>The carving of the Saviour's form is clearly
inferior to that of the decoration which surrounds
it. Amador de los Ríos seeks to account for this
by declaring that &ldquo;the difficulty from the point of
view of art increases in proportion as the size of
the figure is required to be larger&rdquo;&mdash;a statement
with which I wholly disagree. I believe, in

same hand, and that the carver of the decorative
detail was simply the better craftsman of the two.</p>

<p>Many of the statuettes of the Virgin which
are preserved in Spain were probably made in
France. One that is typically and unquestionably
Spanish is the celebrated &ldquo;Virgin of Battles&rdquo;
(Plate <a href="#img_102.jpg">xliii</a>.), now guarded, together with other
relics of Saint Ferdinand (see Vol. I., Plate <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44391/44391-h/44391-h.htm#img_64.jpg">xi</a>xi.),
in the Chapel Royal of Seville cathedral. These
statuettes, the use of which originated with the
Greek emperors, and which were called by the
Byzantines <i>socia belli</i>, consist of a seated figure of
the Virgin with a small door opening underneath
her throne, and served as reliquaries, and also as
a kind of talisman. Boutelou says that the Spanish
warriors of the Middle Ages were accustomed to
carry these images to war with them, fitted upon
a pin protruding from the left side of the saddle-bow.
The &ldquo;Virgin of Battles,&rdquo; made in Spain
in the early part of the thirteenth century, was
thus carried by King Ferdinand the Saint, resting
between his shield or <i>rodela</i> and his left arm, and
so protected, and protecting, in the brunt of war.</p>

<p>The image is of ivory, and measures seventeen
inches in height. The style is primitive Gothic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not as yet emancipated from Romanic and Byzantine
art; and the expression of the Madonna and
her Babe is marked by an engaging sweetness.
Through lapse of centuries, myriads of diminutive
cracks have opened on the surface of the ivory,
and this has turned, in colour, to a brightish
yellow. The right arm of the Virgin was broken
off at some time prior to the sixteenth century,
and has been replaced by another one. Mother
and Child wear crowns of silver-gilt which probably
were added later, and the hair, lips, and
eyes have been badly painted or repainted with
discordant colouring. A four-sided hole bored
deep into the ivory served for holding the image
to the <i>perno</i> which projected from the monarch's
saddle-bow.</p>

<p>A few elaborate <i>baculi</i> or pastoral staves
(Plate <a href="#img_104.jpg">xliv</a>.) exist in Spain, including one of the
fourteenth century, in ivory, which belonged to the
late Marquis of Monistrol, and is carved with the
Crucifixion and also with the Virgin contemplating
the Holy Infant as He is offered cups by angels.
Another interesting Spanish baculus, though not
of ivory, but copper decorated with turquoises and
bright blue enamel, belonged to Bishop Pelayo
de Cebeyra of Mondoñedo (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1199&ndash;1218), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
has been preserved, together with that prelate's
gilded shoes. In the celebrated processions of
Santiago, at which Alfonso the Sixth was personally
present, magnificent ivory <i>baculi</i> were borne,
not only by the archbishop (<i>eburnea virga pontificali
decoratus</i>), but even by the choristers.</p>

<p>Between the eleventh and the fifteenth centuries,
Spanish craftsmen produced a fair quantity
of ivory boxes, reliquaries, diptyches, triptyches,
combs, and other less important objects. A
fifteenth-century ivory spoon, ten inches long,
whose handle is carved with six crocodiles, is in
the National Museum, and may be Spanish work.
In the same collection are one or two ivory
diptyches and leaves of diptyches, and a wooden
box (fourteenth century), with figures of carved
ivory representing passages from the life of Saint
George upon the body of the box, and from the Old
Testament upon the lid. A carved Renaissance
temple of the same material, with the Virgin and
Child in its interior, is probably Italian.</p>

<p>In the fortieth volume of <i>España Sagrada</i> it is
stated that four ivory diptyches (<i>quatuor dictacos
eburneos</i>) were offered in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 897 to Lugo
cathedral by Alfonso the Third and his queen
Jimena. Other ivory diptyches were presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1063 by Ferdinand the Second to the
church of Saint Isidore at León. José Villa-amil,
in his study of an ivory statuette of the
Virgin, belonging to the nuns of Allariz (<i>Boletín
de la Sociedad Española de Excursiones</i>; nos. 76
and 77), mentions a carved ivory box (<i>capsa
eburnea</i>) made in the year 1122 for Santiago
cathedral by order of Archbishop Gelmirez;
another which existed in the sixteenth century in
the church of Santa María at Finisterre; and a
third, used as a reliquary, which in 1572 was
opened by the monks of Samos in presence of
Ambrosio de Morales.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages portable altars (<i>altares
portátiles</i>) were widely used in Spain, and some
were made of ivory. It was the custom to open
them at the time of prayer, and as a rule
they rested upon <i>reclinatorios</i> or hung upon the
wall. The <i>imagen abriente</i> or &ldquo;opening image&rdquo;
was also popular in Spain throughout the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries. As the name implies,
these images opened in the manner of a triptych,
and were very often used as reliquaries. Specimens
are preserved in many parts of Europe,
but only one or two exist in Spain and Portugal.
That which belongs to the nuns of Allariz dates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
from the end of the thirteenth century, and was a
present from Queen Violante. It is described
fantastically by Morales, and accurately by Villa-amil,
but the quaintest account is by the chronicler
Jacobo de Castro. It measures, Castro tells us,
&ldquo;about half-a-yard in length and is one of the
fairest ever seen, since it opens downward from
the neck, discovering, on plates of half-relief, the
principal mysteries of Christ and of Our Lady.
The devotion towards it of the people in this
neighbourhood exceeds description, and God has
wrought a quantity of miracles through the
intercession thereof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fourteenth-century triptych carved in bone
with scenes from Scripture is in the National
Museum. It proceeds from Aragon, and is said to
have belonged to Jayme the Conqueror. The
Escorial possesses a handsome ivory diptych
(Plate <a href="#img_108.jpg">xlvi</a>.) which is either Spanish or Italian&mdash;probably
the former. It measures exactly a foot
in height by nine inches across both leaves, and
is deeply carved with passages from the life of
Christ. The style is late Romanic merging into
Gothic, and points to the second half of the
thirteenth century.</p>

<h2><a name="POTTERY" id="POTTERY">POTTERY</a></h2>

<h3>ANCIENT</h3>

<p>Quantities of ancient common pottery have been,
and are continually being found in many parts of
Spain. Prehistoric cups, shaped with the fingers
and dried and hardened by the sun, are preserved
in the Museum of History at Barcelona. They
were discovered at Argar. Similar objects have
been extracted from the caves of Segóbriga,
Lóbrega in Old Castile, and El Tesoro in the
province of Málaga. Those which were found at
Segóbriga are divided by Capelle into six groups,
one of which includes a vessel resembling the
ordinary Spanish pitcher of to-day.</p>

<p>Villa-amil y Castro has described in the <i>Museo
Español de Antigüedades</i> pieces of prehistoric
sun-dried ware discovered in Galicia, roughly
decorated with patterns imprinted by the finger.
In other instances a double spiral has been described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with a pointed instrument about the
vessel's neck. Similar fragments have been
found by Góngora in Andalusia. Celtic pottery
was found in 1862 by Captain Brome on Windmill
Hill at Gibraltar, in 1866 by M. Lartet in
the caves of Torrecilla de Cameros, and by
Casiano de Prado in a cave near Pedraza, as well
as at Navares de Ayuso and elsewhere. In
central Spain, vessels of the Celtiberian era have
been found in tombs at Prádena, and pieces of
red Saguntine ware, with dark red decoration, at
Otero de Herreros, close to vestiges of a Roman
mine. Lecea y García describes in his work on
<i>Old Segovian Industries</i> a Celtiberian plate of
reddish clay covered with black varnish, which
was dug up some years ago in a garden at that
town. This plate, measuring no less than four
feet in diameter, and containing two inscriptions
in characters believed to be Celtiberian, as well
as the figure of a warrior armed with a lance and
three javelins, was submitted to Heiss, who wrote
of it in the <i>Gazette Archéologique</i> and pronounced
it to be genuine. I have not seen the plate in
question. I have, however, met with cleverly
executed forgeries, also varnished black, of
primitive Spanish pottery.</p>

<p>In 1899 quantities of Celtic ware, believed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
date from the time of the Ph&oelig;nicians, or even
earlier, were unearthed by M. Bonsor from tumuli
in the Guadalquivir valley. These objects are
ornamented in relief with complicated patterns
paler than the ground, obtained by using lighter-coloured
clay. &ldquo;As similar Celtic pottery has
been found in Portugal, it will be understood that
the Celtic influence, having crossed the Pyrenees,
reached the south by the western seaboard. It
will thus be seen that long before the arrival of
the Romans a relatively high degree of civilisation
had been reached at least in the south of
Spain.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1905 two German archæologists,
Messrs. Schulten and Könen, who had
obtained permission from the Spanish Government
to explore the site of old Numancia, filled four
large cases with the Celtiberian pottery they
extracted from the ruins. These cases were forwarded
to the University of Göttingen. I understand,
however, that they have been returned,
or are to be returned immediately, to Spain.</p>

<p>Long before the Christian era, Greek colonies
existed on the Spanish coast at Rhodas, Denia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Emporium (Ampurias), Saguntum (Murviedro),
and elsewhere. Pottery of good design and workmanship
was manufactured at these towns, and
strongly influenced native art. Bowls and other
objects showing such an influence were discovered
by M. Bonsor in his recent excavations. Another
powerful influence was that of Rome. Roman
potteries existed in the suburb of Seville called
Triana, and in the provinces of Cáceres and
Badajoz. Mérida was also an important centre
of this industry, and vessels which were used in
sacred rites, such as the <i>aquiminarium</i>, the
<i>prefericulum</i>, the <i>simpulum</i>, and the <i>urnula</i>, were
discovered here not long ago. The name
&ldquo;Saguntine ware&rdquo; was given by the Romans to a
kind of pottery which seems to have been made
along the Spanish littoral extending southward
from Saguntum. Fragments of this pottery,
which closely resembles the Arezzo ware,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
found in shoals upon the sites of Roman towns,
particularly Tarragona. These <i>barros saguntinos</i>,
or (as Hübner prefers to call them) <i>barros
tarraconenses</i>, have been divided into four classes,
namely, white, grey, red (covered with a dark red
varnish),<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and yellow striped with red. This ware
is commonly adorned with garlands, animals,
hunting-scenes, divinities, games, or religious
ceremonies, and also bears, in nearly every case, the
potter's name or mark; <i>e.g.</i> <span class="smcap">ALBINVS F</span> (&ldquo;Albinus
fecit&rdquo;) or <span class="smcap">OF. ALBIN</span> (&ldquo;officina Albini&rdquo;). More
than two hundred marks have been discovered
which were used by potters of Ampurias alone.</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that Saguntum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and Emporium were principal centres of this
industry, and possibly, since these towns were
old Greek settlements, the <i>barros saguntinos</i> were
of Grecian origin. Pella y Forgas, describing in
his <i>History of the Ampurdan</i> the fine red ware
of this locality, says that parts of the decoration
were fashioned on the wheel, others directly by
the potter's hand, and others from a mould, while
the ornament of dotted lines was made by the
wheeled <i>roulette</i>.</p>

<p>Among the commoner objects dating from
this time are amphoræ and small earthen lamps
(Pl. <a href="#img_116.jpg">xlvii</a>.). These lamps have been discovered in
great numbers, and, owing to the dryness of the
Spanish soil, in excellent preservation. They
measure about the size of the hand, and have two
holes, one in the spout or beak, to hold the wick,
and the other at the top, for pouring in the oil.
The top, which as a rule is slightly concave, is
often ornamented with devices in relief, such as a
chariot and its driver, or the emblem of a deity.</p>

<p class="caption">XLVII<br />AMPHORAIC VASES AND OTHER POTTERY<br />
(<i>Museum of Tarragona</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The typical amphora was a long, narrow vessel
(usually of earthenware; less frequently of brass
or glass), with an elongated handle at either side
of the neck, and tapering nearly to a point. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
served for storing honey, oil, or wine, and in order
to keep it upright the pointed lower end was
stuck into the soil, or rested on a perforated
wooden stand. In the spring of 1893 some fishermen
drew up in their nets, just off the coast of
Alicante, three large intact amphoræ thickly cased
with shells, and sold them for eight dollars each.
Other fine amphoræ, now in the collection of the
Marquis of Cerralbo, were washed upon the
beach at Torrevieja, and many more are in
museums. Vessels of this kind are known to
have been made at Rhodas (Rosas) and Saguntum,
and their use continued in Spain until the downfall
of the second empire.</p>

<h3>HISPANO-MORESQUE NON-LUSTRED POTTERY</h3>

<p>The statements of Saint Isidore, confirmed
by one or two discoveries in southern Spain,
prove that the pottery in use among the Visigoths
was principally Roman. Probably in this, as in so
many of her arts, the Moorish conquest brought
about a radical and rapid change. Remains of
pottery dating from this period are extremely
rare. The provincial museum of Granada contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
some bowls and plates, all more or less imperfect,
which are ascribed by experts to about the
year 1000. These objects, which were dug up in
1878 on the slopes of the Sierra Elvira, a few
miles from Granada, are coloured black and green
upon a white or whitish ground. The most important
is a dish which measures fourteen inches
in diameter, and is decorated with a falcon on a
horse's back (Plate <a href="#img_118.jpg">xlviii</a>.).<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> All of this pottery
shows the double influence of Byzantium and the
East. Among the designs upon the other pieces
are hares and stags surrounded by a bordering of
primitive arabesques. Riaño remarks that &ldquo;it is
almost impossible to assert whether this pottery
was made in or imported into Spain.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
Persians are stated to have settled in this
region early in the days of Muslim rule, while
these dilapidated specimens of ancient ware are
greatly similar in colouring and substance to the
common dishes and <i>barreños</i> which are still produced
throughout the province of Granada.</p>

<p>Moorish potteries producing lustred or non-lustred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
ware existed from an early date at Málaga,
Valencia, Toledo, Calatayud, Murviedro, Murcia,
and Barcelona. Another centre of this craft was
probably Granada; for though she is not mentioned
in this sense by any of the Moorish authors, the
late Señor Contreras discovered here the vestiges
of two ancient potteries, while one of the old
entrances was known as Bab Alfajjarin, or &ldquo;the
potters' gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">XLVIII<br />DISH<br />
(<i>About A.D. 1000. Museum of Granada</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The Ordinances of Granada contain provisions
which were evidently copied from the Spanish
Moors, relating to the <i>almadraveros</i> or tilemakers,
the <i>tinajeros</i> or makers of <i>tinajas</i>, and the <i>olleros</i>
or potters generally. The Ordinances which
concern the tilemakers are dated between 1528
and 1540. The restrictions imposed upon these
craftsmen were irksome, foolish, and unnecessary.
All bricks and tiles were to be stamped in three
places with the city mark, and were only permitted
to be made between the first of April and the
thirty-first of October in each year, &ldquo;since what
is made at other seasons is not good or perfect,
owing to the rain, and cold, and frost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another Ordinance, illustrating the lawlessness
prevailing at Granada in the times succeeding the
reconquest, complains that &ldquo;many persons, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
labourers and hodmen, go forth into the
roads and streets, and seize the tiles and bricks
by violence from those who are conveying them,
and bear them to their houses, or to the work
which they are paid to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A picturesque, though cheap and unluxurious,
vessel of a thoroughly eastern character, and
which was very largely manufactured by the
Spanish Moors, is the terra-cotta <i>tinaja</i> or
gigantic jar for storing wine, or olive oil, or grain
(Plate <a href="#img_120.jpg">xlix</a>.). The use of these receptacles extended
through the whole Peninsula, and has continued
undiminished to this day. The principal
centres of <i>tinaja</i>-making were Toledo, Seville,
and Granada. The Ordinances of the latter town
embody Moorish rules relating to this branch
of pottery. These laws, revived in 1526, provide
that all <i>tinajas</i> must contain two kinds of earth,
one red, the other white, thoroughly compounded
in a trough of water. Before the potter removes
the clay from the trough, he must call the city
supervisor or <i>veedor</i> to look into the quality and
mixing of the mass. The vessel as it leaves the
oven must be white; otherwise, even although it
have no flaw, the inspector is to break it. The
potter is forbidden to coat his <i>tinajas</i> with a glaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
composed of eggs, blood, chalk, and other strange
ingredients; nor may he fire the glaze with
torches, &ldquo;because the smell of the smoke clings
to the <i>tinaja</i>, and the wine or stum deposited
therein grows redolent of it, and it stays within
the jar perpetually.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">XLIX<br />HISPANO-MORESQUE <i>TINAJA</i></p>
</div>

<p>Owing doubtless to their plain, domestic purpose
and their trifling market cost, early <i>tinajas</i> are
not often met with. A fine example in excellent
preservation is at South Kensington, and is
described by Riaño as &ldquo;a wine jar, amphora-shaped,
and ornamented with an incised pattern
of vine leaves, and stamped diaper of a Gothic
character.&rdquo; Several good <i>tinajas</i> have been discovered
of late years at Seville. Gestoso mentions
six, five of which are glazed. The first of these
was found in 1893, and has a bright green glaze
upon a ground of reddish earth. Both handles
and nearly all the neck are wanting. The decoration
consists of various bands or <i>fajas</i> round the
body of the jar, a series of archways, another of
leaves, and a central band of stars, three deep,
strongly imprinted from a mould. In every
ninth arch are stamped symbolic hands, such as
we see upon the Gate of Justice of the Alhambra.</p>

<p>The second <i>tinaja</i> is similar to the one just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mentioned, except that it has the neck. It
was discovered in 1895, and is now in Seville
museum.</p>

<p>The third <i>tinaja</i> is also in this museum, and
was discovered in 1901. It is in a very poor condition,
and Gestoso believes that it was originally
covered with a honey-coloured glaze.</p>

<p>The fourth <i>tinaja</i> was found in a drain, in the
same year as the preceding one, and is inscribed
with words, including <i>Blessing</i> and <i>Felicity</i>, in
Cufic characters. Gestoso is unable to decide
whether this vessel was made at Seville or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The fifth <i>tinaja</i> is in the collection of Don José
Morón, and possesses greater interest than the
others, both because it is in excellent condition,
and also because the decoration is entirely in the
Spanish-Christian style, without a trace of Saracenic
ornament. Small Gothic-looking shields surround
the body of this vessel, which is stamped
with pomegranates, and with the arms and emblems
of the Ponce de León and other families.
Between each pair of shields is an oval-shaped
medallion containing human figures.</p>

<p>The sixth <i>tinaja</i> is unglazed. It was found in
June of 1893, and is adorned with repetitions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the words <i>Prosperity</i> and <i>Blessing</i>, as well as with
a series of deer and other animals in the act of
running; some of them with birds upon their
backs. These designs are very uncommon, and
Gestoso has seen no other <i>tinaja</i>, proceeding from
this region, similarly decorated.</p>

<p><i>Tinajas</i> are still made in large quantities at
Toboso, Lucena, Colmenar de Oreja, and other
Spanish towns and villages.</p>

<p>Other large objects of a thoroughly oriental
character were earthenware glazed <i>brocales</i> or
brims of wells, which, like the <i>tinajas</i>, were largely
manufactured at Seville and Toledo. Specimens
of these <i>brocales</i> exist in the museums of Toledo
and Cordova. Riaño describes one which is at
South Kensington. &ldquo;It was bought at Toledo
for three guineas at a shoemaker's shop. It is
made of glazed white and green earthenware,
with ornamental Cufic characters in high relief
all round, which appear to be of the fourteenth
century. The inscription, which is repeated, is
imperfect, and all that I can decipher are the
words &lsquo;the power, the excellence, and the peace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gestoso describes two <i>brocales</i> and the fragments
of a third. All these objects were found
at Seville. The two which are intact, or nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
so, are cylindrical, and of a white ware. One of
them has a simple leaf decoration, and seems to
have been covered with a green glaze. The
other, which was discovered in 1894, is surrounded
by a triple band of inscription in African characters
which are illegible.</p>

<p>Gestoso also describes some interesting baptismal
fonts, a class of object which he pronounces
to have been the most important of all that were
produced in the potteries of Triana, by reason
both of their large dimensions and of their elaborate
ornamentation. He states that three methods
were employed to decorate these fonts. The first
consisted in attaching to their surface small
moulded plates which bore the likeness of a saint,
flowers, monograms, or other devices. By the
second method the decoration was moulded directly
on the font; while the third method consisted in
a combination of the other two.</p>

<p>Splendid examples of these Spanish fonts exist
in various churches of Andalusia and in private
collections. One of the finest is in the parish
church of Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, at
Laguna, Tenerife. It is suggested by Gestoso
that this <i>pila</i> of Laguna was made at Seville and
sent to the Canaries in the year 1479, when orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were issued by Ferdinand and Isabella for the
completion of the monasteries in those islands.</p>

<p><i>Pilas</i> were also manufactured at Toledo,
although Gestoso says that the workmanship of
those produced at Seville was in every way
superior. Nevertheless, he has only found the
maker's name upon a single font, which is inscribed
with that of Juan Sanchez Vachero, and is now
preserved in the church of San Pedro at Carmona.
Another remarkable <i>pila</i> is that of the hospital of
San Lázaro at Seville.</p>

<p>In course of time the Spanish Church forbade
the use of <i>pilas</i> made of glazed earthenware, and
ordered their substitution by fonts of stone or
marble. One of these dispositions, included
among the <i>Constituciones Sinodales</i> of the bishopric
of Málaga, and dated 1671, is quoted by
Gestoso. It enacts that the <i>pila</i> be of stone and
not of earthenware, and that if any of this latter
class remain, they are to be &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
destroyed) within two months.</p>

<p>Returning to the Ordinances of Granada, those
which concern the potters or <i>olleros</i> generally are
dated 1530, and inform us of the price of glazed
and unglazed articles in common use, such as
<i>ollas</i> or pots (with and without glaze), <i>cazuelas</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
earthen vessels for cooking meat, plates of many
colours and dimensions, <i>jarros</i> (jugs), <i>alcuzas</i>
(vials), <i>cantaros castellanos</i> (Castilian water-pitchers),
<i>cantaros moriscos</i> (Moorish water-pitchers<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>),
<i>morteros</i> (mortars), <i>lebrillos</i> (earthen
tubs), <i>candiles</i> (lamps with a green, white or
yellow glaze), <i>orzas</i> (gally pots), <i>botijas</i> (narrow-necked
jars), and <i>salseras</i> (saucers).</p>

<p>The shape and colouring of many of these
common articles have been continued till to-day,
especially in Andalusia. I reproduce a photograph
of some (Plate <a href="#img_126.jpg">l</a>.), in which the influence of the
East is unmistakable. The smaller of the two
unglazed jars is used for carrying and cooling
water, and is made at Loja. The other, which is
often used for storing honey, is from Guadalajara.
The spherical vessel is a kind of bottle for <i>aguardiente</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
It is glazed a brightish green, and is made
in various parts of Andalusia, as are the gourd-shaped
<i>calabazas</i>, which have a yellow glaze.
The smallest vessel, or that which has a funnel-shaped
and bulging mouth, is coated with a coarse
metallic glaze coloured in white and blue, and
proceeds from Granada.</p>

<p>So is the influence of the Spanish Moors, linking
the present intimately to the past, and
handed down by early craftsmen to the moderns,
and from Mussulmans to Christian Spaniards,
maintained and kept alive, not only by the city
ordinances I have quoted, but also by the more
occult yet no less permanent and cogent force of
local and unchronicled tradition. In the historic
quarter of Granada which is called the Albaycin,
survive a few <i>alfarerías</i> to this hour (Plate <a href="#img_192.jpg">lxix</a>.).
Here, on the potter's wheel or ranged about his
yard, may yet be seen the red Granada earth that is
believed to have inspired the vase of the Alhambra,
applied to-day to common crockery that notwithstanding
has a subtle, unfamiliar charm. And
towards the time of sundown, when the master
turns indoors to supper and his workmen have gone
home, when the last of the red light is colouring the
ancient city wall until it too looks like a mammoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
monument of the potter's art of old Granada, it is
a strange experience to wander through these
desolate yards, among the files of ruddy Granadino
ware kindling with vivid memories of the vanished
Mussulmans of Spain, and bringing back to us
that spirited old poet of the East who also sang of
pottery:&mdash;</p>

<h3>MOSAIC-WORK AND TILES</h3>

<p>The art of colouring and glazing earthenware
was practised by various peoples of the ancient
eastern world, and passed, in course of time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
through Egypt to Ph&oelig;nicia, Greece, and Rome,
and, later still, to Mussulman peoples of north-western
Africa.</p>

<p>Glazed earthenware was possibly produced in
Roman Spain, although the specimens of it which
have been discovered are singularly and, indeed,
significantly few. Their colour is commonly green
or lightish yellow. Gestoso makes particular
mention of a small jar now preserved in the
museum of Seville, describing it as &ldquo;of an
ordinary shape, but finely made.&rdquo; He admits,
however, that no trace of glaze exists in any of
the broken Visigothic vessels (copied, as Saint
Isidore tells us, from the Roman-Spanish pottery)
that were found some years ago among the ruins
of Italica. Thus it is not decided whether the
Spanish potters learned to glaze, or whether this
development of their craft remained familiar to
the Spaniards of that period through imported
objects merely.</p>

<p>As with glazed earthenware, the origin of
mosaic must be looked for in the East. Greece,
who had doubtless borrowed it from Egypt,
communicated it to Rome at least two centuries
before the Christian era, and from this time the
Romans used it freely in the decoration of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
buildings. The Greek mosaic was composed exclusively
of stone. The Romans modified this
usage by the introduction of diminutive cubes of
clay, painted and baked like porcelain; and later,
in the reign of Claudius, dyed these cubes with
various colours.</p>

<p>Roman mosaic-work (commonly in the tessellated
style and not the <i>opus sectile</i>) has been unearthed
in many parts of the Peninsula. Such are the
two &ldquo;mosaics of the Muses,&rdquo; discovered at Italica
on December 12th, 1799, and June 12th, 1839;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
other mosaics, to the number of some thirty,
discovered from time to time among the same
ruins; another, discovered at Majorca in 1833;
that of the Calle Batitales at Lugo (the Roman
<i>Lucus Augusti</i>), discovered in 1842; those of
Palencia, Gerona, Merida, Milla del Rio (near
León), Rielves (near Toledo), Duratón, Aguilafuente,
and Paradinas (near Segovia), and Carabanchel,
three miles from Madrid. The mosaic
found at Lugo is believed to have formed part of
a temple dedicated to Diana. The decoration is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
partly geometrical, and consists of the head of
a man between two dolphins, with other fishes
swimming along the border. Laborde describes
another mosaic which existed, early in the nineteenth
century, in a hall of the archbishop's palace
at Valencia. &ldquo;The pavement of this hall demands
particular attention; it is formed of antique pavements,
discovered in the month of February,
1777, three hundred paces north-east of the town
of Puch, between Valencia and Murviedro; some
were entire, others were only fragments. They
were separated with care, and placed on the floor
of this hall, where they are carefully preserved.
They are different mosaics, formed by little stones
of three or four lines in diameter, curiously enchased.
They are distributed into seven squares
in each of which medallions and divers designs
have been drawn: their compartments are of blue
on a white ground. We observe in one of these
squares an imitation of the pavement of Bacchus,
discovered at Murviedro, and of which there remained
but very few vestiges; it was copied in
a drawing-book which a priest of this town had
preserved; it is executed with such art and exactness,
that no difference can be observed between
this modern work and that of the Romans. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
another we see Neptune seated in a car, in one
hand holding a whip, and in the other a trident
and the reins of the horses by which his car is
drawn: these appear to be galloping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the same hall are also seen other pavements,
of which only fragments could be preserved.
Some serve for borders and ornaments to the
preceding pavements. On these are represented a
tiger, fishes, birds, houses, flowers, and garlands,
well executed. There are particularly five stuck
on wood and shut up in a closet; on these are
birds, fruits, and flowers, figured in different
colours, the execution of which is very curious;
they are perhaps the most precious of the
whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same author says elsewhere: &ldquo;In digging
to make a road from Valencia to Murviedro in
1755, at the entrance of the latter town a mosaic
pavement was discovered; it was entire, and of
such beauty that it was thought worthy of preservation.
Ferdinand the Sixth caused it to be
surrounded with walls; but the king's intentions
were not properly fulfilled; the gates were suffered
to remain open, and every one carried away some
part of the pavement, which consequently soon became
despoiled; it was rectangular, and measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
twenty-four feet by fourteen. There are still
some fragments of it in several houses at
Murviedro. A priest of that town, Don Diego
Puch, an antiquarian, took a drawing of it, which
he afterwards had painted at Valencia on the tiles
fabricated there, and paved an apartment of his
house with them. It was likewise copied with
the greatest exactness, with small stones perfectly
similar, in an apartment of the library belonging
to the archiepiscopal palace, as we have already
stated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swinburne also mentions a mosaic pavement
which he saw at Barcelona, upon the site of what
he believed to have been a temple of Neptune.
In it were represented &ldquo;two large green figures
of tritons, holding a shell in each hand; between
them a sea-horse, and on the sides a serpent and
a dolphin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In October of 1901 a very important and
beautiful mosaic was discovered at Italica. It is
known as &ldquo;the mosaic of Bacchus,&rdquo; the worship
of which deity, says Señor Quintero, was probably
general in Andalusia, owing to her wealth of
vines. This mosaic was found at a depth of six
feet six inches below the surface of the soil, and
measures twenty-one feet square. It is believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to have formed the pavement of a Roman dining-chamber.</p>

<p>Mosaic in the manner of the Greeks and
Romans seems in Spain to have disappeared with
the Visigoths. That it was known to these is
told us by Saint Isidore:&mdash;&ldquo;Pavimenta originem
apud graecos habent elaboratae arte picturae,
litostrata parvulis crustis ac tesselis tinctis in
varios colores.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to affirm with any confidence
that glazed earthenware, whether in the form of
tiles or other objects, was manufactured by the
Spanish Moors during the Cordovese Caliphate,
or the period of the kinglings of Taifa. No trace
of it has been discovered among the scanty ruins
of Medina Az-zahará<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and Az-zahira&mdash;ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
palaces of Cordova&mdash;or in the marvellous mosque.
We know, however, that towards the seventh
century the Arabs borrowed from Byzantium
the mosaic-work of tessons known as <i>psephosis
fsefysa</i>, and this, or something similar, was used,
though probably to a small extent, among the
Muslims of the Spanish Caliphate. Although,
towards the middle of the thirteenth century,
the historian Aben-Said, a native of Granada,
recorded that in Al-Andalus &ldquo;is made a kind of
<i>mofassass</i> which is called in the East <i>alfoseifesa</i>,&rdquo;
remains of this elaborate product only exist to-day
at Cordova, where patches may yet be seen lining
the dome of the <i>mirhab</i> in the vast <i>aljama</i>
(Plate <a href="#img_134.jpg">li</a>.). The mosaic in question is stated to
have been a gift from the Byzantine emperor to
the sultan Al-Hakem, and was set in place by a
skilled workman, a Greek, who, like the offering
itself, proceeded from Constantinople.</p>

<p>During his stay at Cordova this Greek was
helped by certain of the Sultan's slaves, who thus
acquired the secrets of the craft, and practised it
thereafter.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Rodrigo Amador de los Rios contends, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that this decoration is in no sense a true mosaic,
but just a tempera painting executed on the wall
and overlaid with cubes of glass. In any case, no
other specimen of such work has been discovered
in any part of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>By the time of the Almohade invasion or very
shortly after&mdash;that is, towards the twelfth century,&mdash;the
Spanish Moors had grown acquainted
with glazed earthenware. Indeed, the Almohades
are believed by some authorities to have actually
introduced it. Gestoso, on the contrary, suggests
that Spain may have transmitted it to Africa.
However this may be, the Almohades used it
largely in the decoration of their homes and public
buildings in Andalusia; first as <i>aliceres</i> or bands
composed of smallish pieces running round a room,
and subsequently in the more effective and more
useful form of <i>azulejos</i> proper. The Spanish Moors
employed the word <i>almofassass</i> to designate both
<i>aliceres</i> and <i>azulejos</i>. Nevertheless, the two were
not identical, although Riaño takes them to be so.
He says: &ldquo;The earliest tiles or <i>azulejos</i> made in
Spain are composed of small pieces let into the
wall, forming geometrical patterns.&rdquo; These, in
fact, were <i>aliceres</i>. It is not so easy to define
an <i>azulejo</i>. We read in Aben-Said, quoted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Al-Makkari: &ldquo;There is another kind of work
employed for paving houses. It is called <i>azzulechí</i>
and resembles <i>mofassass</i>. It has wonderful
colouring, and replaces the coloured marble
used by the people of the East to decorate their
chambers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This definition is not completely clear. Those
of the Christian-Spanish writers are not more
satisfactory. Covarrubias calls these objects
&ldquo;small bricks, square and of other shapes, used
for lining chambers in the mansions of the wealthy,
or in garden paths.&rdquo; Nebrija calls them <i>tessela
pavimenticia</i>, adding that they bear the name of
<i>azulejos</i> because the earliest ones were of a blue
colour&mdash;a statement which Dozy supports by
instancing the Persian-Arabic <i>zaward</i> or &ldquo;blue
stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gestoso resolves the question sufficiently for
our purpose by showing that the term <i>azulejo</i> is
usually applied to square tiles of a largish size,
the length of whose sides varies between eleven
centimetres and eighteen centimetres, <i>aliceres</i>
being properly the smaller strips or pieces
(technically known as <i>cintas</i> or <i>verduguillos</i>) used
in a bordering or frieze. Other decorative pieces
of small dimensions, invented in the fifteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
century, were called <i>olambres</i> or <i>olambrillas</i>, and
served to lend variety to the red or yellow brickwork
of a pavement or a floor.</p>

<p>The production of <i>azulejos</i> in Spain may thus
be traced to as far back as the twelfth century.
By far the most important centre of the craft
was Seville. Here, from the twelfth until the
fourteenth century, was made the glazed and
decorative tiling which consisted of small pieces
of monochrome earthenware&mdash;black, white, green,
blue, or yellow&mdash;cut one by one, and pieced
together in the manner of a true mosaic. This
process, says Gestoso, was lengthy, difficult, and
dear. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
same mosaic would often take the form of a series
of narrow, white, ribbon-like strips, with coloured
interspaces. Specimens of this &ldquo;ribbon-work
tiling&rdquo; exist to-day in the Patio de Las Doncellas
of the Alcázar (Plate <a href="#img_138.jpg">lii</a>.). Towards the sixteenth
century the Sevillano potters discovered a simpler
way of making effective and artistic <i>azulejos</i>, which
they called the <i>cuerda seca</i> process. This novel
method consisted in pressing a wood or metal
mould upon the unbaked tile, in such a manner
that the outline of the pattern remained in slight
relief. This outline was next brushed over with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a mixture of manganese and grease, which turns,
in baking, very nearly black. The body of the
pattern was then filled in with the various colours,
which the greasy line completely separated, and
thus prepared, the tile was rendered permanent
by firing.</p>

<p class="caption">LII<br />MOSAIC OF THE PATIO DE LAS DONCELLAS<br />
(<i>Alcázar of Seville</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>This process, in which the patterns are nearly
always geometrical, remained in general use until
about the year 1550, when it began to be superseded
by two others, known respectively as the
processes of &ldquo;cuenca&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pisano&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The <i>cuenca</i> tile was simple and of excellent
effect. The pattern, stamped from a metal
mould, remained in bas-relief,&mdash;a characteristic
which caused these objects to be also known as
<i>azulejos</i> &ldquo;<i>de relieve</i>&rdquo;. The shelving border of
each hollow stamped into the tile thus formed
a kind of natural barrier which kept the colour
there deposited from mingling with its neighbours.
When of a larger size, and joined in pairs to form
between each two a single motive (<i>ladrillo por
tabla</i>), these <i>azulejos</i> were often employed for
decorating roofs and ceilings.</p>

<p>The tiles which bear the name of their inventor,
Francesco Niculoso Pisano the Italian, who lived
and worked for many years at Seville, date from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
about the same time as the &ldquo;cuenca&rdquo; <i>azulejos</i>. In
the case of the <i>Pisano</i> tile, there is no indentation
caused by the imprint of a mould, the surface
being merely coated with a monochrome glaze,
painted upon and fired, the decoration thus
remaining flat all over. Commonly the ground
is white or yellow, with the colour of the pattern
shaded blue, or black, or deepish purple. This
process, which lent itself to most elaborate and
effective schemes of ornament, remained in vogue
until the eighteenth century, and was practised,
not only by Pisano himself, but by a long succession
of his pupils, followers, and imitators.</p>

</div>

<p>Such were the processes in use among the
<i>azulejo</i>-makers of old Seville. Specimens of
their craftsmanship which yet survive and illustrate
the various styles and epochs may be thus
enumerated:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Mosaic tile-work, such as appears in Seville
at the time of the Almohade invasion. A fragment
of this kind of work forms part of the collection of
Señor Osma, and proceeds from the church of
San Andrés. Tiles and smaller pieces of mosaic-work,
coloured in malachite green and white,
were also found in 1899 and 1900, in the upper
walls of the renowned Torre del Oro, or &ldquo;Golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Tower,&rdquo; erected in the year 1220, and which is
popularly thought to derive its venerable title
from the sparkle of the sun upon its <i>azulejos</i>.
Another piece of primitive mosaic, measuring
rather less than a yard square, and containing
star-shaped geometrical devices, was found in 1890
beneath the floor of the cathedral; while mosaics
of a later age, including the more elaborate <i>lacería</i>
patterns that resemble ribbon, are preserved in
the Patio de las Doncellas of the Alcázar, in the
Casa de Olea, and in the parish churches of San
Estéban, San Gil, and Omnium Sanctorum.</p>

<p>(2) A small group of curious tiles, believed to
be anterior to the reign of Pedro the First, has
come to light some years ago, in the churches of
San Andrés and Santa Marina, and in the Claustro
del Lagarto of the cathedral. Those of San
Andrés are of white earthenware, glazed in the
same colour and stamped from a mould with the
figures of two wolves in fairly bold relief (see
tailpiece to this chapter). Traces of a glaze of
malachite green are on the bodies of these wolves.
The <i>azulejos</i> of the church of Santa Marina, also
discovered recently, are examined by Señor Osma
in his pamphlet <i>Azulejos sevillanos del siglo xiii</i>
(Madrid, 1902). They measure about three and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a half inches square, and bear devices of a castle
and an eagle, stamped in the diagonal direction
of the tile, showing that this was fixed upon the
wall in lozenge fashion. The tiles are bathed
upon their surface with what is termed by Osma
&ldquo;the semi-transparent, caramel-coloured glaze
peculiar to the pottery of Moorish Spain.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Upon
this ground is stamped the decoration,&mdash;the eagles
in the blackish purple of baked manganese, the
castles without additional colour, so as to be
distinguished only by their outline from the
yellowish surface of the tile.</p>

<p>The <i>azulejos</i> of the Claustro del Lagarto of the
cathedral are three in number, and were found in
1888. Two of them are stamped with a castle of
a single tower described within a shield, and the
third with a Greek cross. These are considered
by Osma to be the only tiles existing at this
moment which date from the latter third of the
thirteenth century. In fact, he places their manufacture
between the years 1252 and 1269.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Cuerda seca</i> tiles. Handsome <i>zocalos</i> or
dadoes of these tiles are in the Casa de los<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Pinelos, and in the chapels of the palaces of the
Dukes of Alba and Medinaceli. Gestoso attributes
them to the end of the fifteenth century
or the beginning of the sixteenth. Detached
<i>cuerda seca</i> tiles are preserved in the municipal
museum of archæology, while a fine pair (Plate <a href="#img_140.jpg">liii</a>.)
of this class of <i>azulejos</i> belongs to Señor Osma,
who considers they were made between 1480 and
1495. They are thus coeval with the no less interesting
dish of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella,
of which a reproduction is given opposite page 190.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Cuenca</i> tiles. Quantities of these, dating
from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, may
yet be seen in many parts of Seville; for instance,
in her churches or her convents, in her superb
Alcázar, or in the mansions of her old nobility.
Probably the most remarkable of all are those in
the gardens of the Alcázar, and lining the walls of
the Pavilion of Charles the Fifth. The devices
on these polychrome <i>azulejos</i> (16th century;
Plate <a href="#img_142.jpg">liv</a>.) are very numerous, including men and
animals, centaurs and other monsters, the Pillars of
Hercules, and imitations of elaborate dress fabrics.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Pisano</i> tiles. Although some facts have
been unearthed concerning the Italian Francesco
Niculoso Pisano, we do not know precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in what year he came to Seville, or in what
year he died. Davillier thought it probable that
he had studied at Faenza or at Caffagiolo. At
all events, it was Pisano who broadly launched the
art of the Sevillian potters on the stream of the
Renaissance.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> I have stated that the tiles which
bear his name are painted on a white or yellow
ground. Consequently their surface is flat,
without the ridges and depressions of the <i>cuenca</i> or
the <i>cuerda seca</i> methods. We find <i>Pisano</i> tiles
applied to various objects, such as tombs, altars,
friezes, and archivolts. This artist, says Gestoso,
further introduced the use of two new colours,&mdash;violet
and rose. Several of his best productions
are still intact, including the doorway of the church
of the monastery of Santa Paula (in which he was
assisted by a Spanish master, Pedro Millan), and
the altar of the Catholic Sovereigns in the Alcázar.
Both these masterpieces were executed in the
year 1504, and bear Pisano's signature. The
doorway of Santa Paula is described by Gestoso
as consisting of a single body of masonry,
distinct from that of the building itself, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
resting against it, and constructed of bricks of
uniform size, which show us, by their perfect
symmetry, how skilful were the masons of that
time, with whom the Moorish craftsmanship was
yet a living power. The doorway is formed by a
series of concentric Gothic arches resting on
slender pillars. The space which forms the outer
archivolt is most remarkable. Upon a ground
of <i>azulejos</i> which copy the colour of the brickwork,
we see a number of Plateresque designs of exquisite
beauty, painted in white and blue, with
occasional touches of other colours. Among
the devices are chimeras, war-trophies, volutes,
chaplets, parapegms, antelopes, masks, and others
which are characteristic of the Florentine Renaissance.
Upon this ground, and enclosed by circular
garlands in high relief, consisting of polychrome
fruits and flowers, are seven medallions containing
figures of male and female saints, except the one
which is upon the keystone, and which represents
the birth of Christ. In this medallion the figures
are enamelled in white upon a cobalt-blue ground,
recalling, as also do the garlands, the work of the
celebrated della Robbia.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
medallions the figures are glazed in brilliant
colours. In the three medallions upon the left,
beginning with the lowest one, we see, upon the
first, Saint Helen; upon the second, two saints
in monkish dress; and upon the third, Saint Peter
and Saint Paul. On the medallions of the other
side are another saint dressed as a monk, San
Cosmé, San Damián, and San Roque. The
spaces on either side of the archivolt are covered
with tiles which represent a landscape. In each
of the upper angles is an angel holding a large
tablet with IHS in ornamental Gothic character
upon a black ground. These letters, and also
the angels and the frames of the tablets, are
enamelled in gold. Beneath each tablet is an
angel standing with extended wings upon a
bracket of lustred earthenware, and holding an
open book. The brickwork of the door is closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
by a plain impost supporting a small battlement
covered with <i>cuenca</i> tiles, and crowned with a
cornice of flamboyant ornaments alternating with
the heads of cherubs glazed in white, and with a
white marble cross in the centre. The tympanum
is embellished by a superb shield carved in high
relief upon white marble with the arms of Castile,
León, Aragon, and Sicily, surmounted by a royal
crown and the eagle with the nimbus. Beside this
shield are two smaller ones of <i>azulejos</i> painted with
the yoke and sheaf of arrows, and the motto <span class="smcap">T&#256;TO
M&#332;TA</span>. The ground on which are executed these
three shields occupies the whole tympanum, and
is covered with Plateresque devices including two
tablets, on one of which we read the letters <span class="smcap">S.P.Q.R.</span>,
and on the other, <span class="smcap">PISANO</span>. Above the first of these
tablets is another of an oval shape, bearing the word
<span class="smcap">NICULOSO</span>. Lastly, at the base of the archivolt,
and on the left-hand side of the spectator, is a very
small rectangular tablet with this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">NICVLOSO<br />
FRANCISCO-I-<br />

<p>The altar in the Alcázar of the same city, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
which is known as that of the Catholic Sovereigns
(Plate <a href="#img_148.jpg">lv</a>.), is entirely covered with &ldquo;Pisano&rdquo;
<i>azulejos</i> measuring sixteen centimetres square.
Imbedded in the centre is a picture, also of painted
tiles, representing the visit of the Virgin to Saint
Elizabeth. This picture measures five feet in
height by three feet eight inches in breadth. Beneath
it is the figure of a patriarch resting his head
upon his hand. Boughs with large flowers issue
from his breast, and among the flowers are half-length
figures of the prophets, together with those
of Jesus and the Virgin, the whole of this decoration
forming a frame to the central picture. The rest
of the altar is profusely decorated with designs in
the Renaissance style, consisting of vases, animals,
genii, and the emblems of Ferdinand and Isabella.
In the centre of the tiling which forms the altar-front
is a circular picture made of <i>azulejos</i> surrounded
by a garland of fruits and laurel leaves,
and representing the Annunciation, garland and
picture being supported by two monsters with the
tails of dragons and the upper parts of women.
Large flaming torches rest between the out-stretched
arms of the monsters, and round about
or springing from them are flowers, animals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
cornucopias, and other decoration. The entire
<i>retablo</i> is painted lightish blue and white upon a
yellow ground, except the larger picture and its
decorative border, which is of a deeper blue. A
small tablet beneath the Virgin's feet contains the
words <span class="smcap">NICULOSO FRANCESCO ITALIANO ME FECIT</span>, and
on the pilaster represented on the left hand of the
same picture is added the date, 1504. As Gestoso,
Davillier, and others have remarked, it is evident
that while the rest of the altar is pure Renaissance-Plateresque,
the pictures copied on the tiles are of
a northern school. Probably they were designed
for Niculoso by one of the various German or
Flemish masters who at that time were resident
in Seville.</p>

(<i>Alcázar of Seville</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Another altar which was formerly in the same
palace, but which has disappeared, was also
painted by this craftsman. It was described by
Cean Bermudez as containing scenes from the
life of the Virgin, the Trinity, and the two Saints
John, and bore the same date as the altar which
is yet existing, namely, 1504.</p>

<p>Among the other works of Niculoso are the
altar of the church of Tentudia, the tomb of
Iñigo Lopez in the church of Santa Ana in the
quarter of Triana, and a tile-picture representing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
similarly to the one which forms the centre of the
altar in the Alcázar, the Virgin's visit to Saint
Elizabeth. This picture formerly belonged to
the kings of Portugal, and is now in the museum
of Amsterdam.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Such were the decorative <i>azulejos</i> which made
the potteries of Seville famous throughout Europe,
and which are known to have been exported to
Italy, Portugal, and even England.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The names
of several hundred mediæval and post-mediæval
makers of these Seville tiles have been exhumed
and published by Gestoso.</p>

<p>The general title of the Spanish potter was
<i>ollero</i>, a comprehensive term which reaches from
the most ambitious <i>azulejero</i> to the maker of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
meanest kitchen-ware. The <i>olleros</i> of older
Seville produced for centuries, not only glazed
and coloured tiling by the processes already
indicated, but countless other objects such as
brims of wells, apothecary's jars, baptismal fonts,
and dishes of every shape and size. They used a
general mark (the tower of the Giralda) to stamp
their pottery; but private marks are nearly
always absent. The facts that have appeared in
recent years concerning these artificers are seldom
interesting. The mere mention of a name is
meaningless, or even perplexing, seeing that a
Moor or Mudejar would frequently assume the
name and surname of a Christian. Nevertheless,
Gestoso has brought to light important notices
concerning one or two, and in particular a document
dating from the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella, relating to a celebrated potter of that
period named Fernan Martinez Guijarro. This
document, which is dated 1479, describes Martinez
as &ldquo;a very great master in the art of making
<i>azulejos</i>, fonts, and all the things pertaining to
his trade, insomuch that none other in all this
kingdom is like unto him,&rdquo; and subsequently,
&ldquo;considering him to be so excellent a craftsman
that persons come hither from Portugal and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
parts to purchase and to carry off his ware.&rdquo; It
is further stated that Martinez Guijarro was in
wealthy circumstances (&ldquo;hombre rrico e de mucha
rrenta e fasyenda&rdquo;). His <i>talleres</i> or workshops
were in the <i>barrio</i> of Triana, and included (as we
learn from one of the documents copied by the
same investigator) a separate department for the
manufacture or storage of lustred ware.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even Gestoso is unable to point
to any piece of tiling or other pottery now existing,
as being unquestionably executed by this master.</p>

<p>Another Sevillian potter of exceptional merit
was Cristóbal de Augusta, who worked in the
latter half of the sixteenth century, and left his
name upon the <i>azulejo</i> dadoes of the Halls of
Charles the Fifth in the Alcázar. The style of
these most brilliant tiles is pure Renaissance, and
forms a worthy continuation of the splendid work
of Niculoso. Augusta, indeed, is termed in the
Archives of the Alcázar &ldquo;master of making tiles
in the Pisano manner&rdquo; (<i>del pisano</i>).<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Some tilemakers
of little note succeeded him, but even the
names of these are carefully recorded by Gestoso.</p>

<p>Seville was thus the principal centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
craft of decorative tile-making. <i>Azulejos</i> were
also made at Barcelona and other towns in Cataluña,
at Talavera de la Reina, Burgos, Toledo,
Granada, and Valencia, in several towns of
Aragon, and probably at Cordova. Riaño quotes
a letter written about the year 1422, from the wife
of the Admiral of Castile to the abbess of the
nunnery of Santo Domingo at Toledo, requesting
that a number of <i>azulejos</i> be sent to her. &ldquo;She
alludes, in the same letter, to painted tiles, and
says she was expecting a master potter from
Seville to place the tiles in their proper places.
This shows us&rdquo; (continues Riaño) &ldquo;that it was
only in the province of Andalusia that the art was
known of cutting these tiles into geometrical sections
and mosaic patterns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meaning of this passage is obscure. Riaño
speaks of painted tiles and <i>azulejos</i> as though they
were distinct objects, and yet they are essentially
the same. Again, if only Andalusia was able to
produce such tiles, why did the Almirante's wife
order them from Toledo? Perhaps the faulty
English of Riaño's handbook is responsible, but,
as it stands, this passage tells us practically nothing.
In any case, abundant evidence exists to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that large quantities of Mudejar and Renaissance
tiles were manufactured at Toledo. In general
appearance, they are similar to those of Seville.</p>

<p>Ramírez de Arellano believes that decorative
tiles were manufactured at Cordova in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, and quotes, in proof
of this, the names of &ldquo;maestros de hacer vidriado&rdquo;
or makers of glazed ware, who resided at this
ancient capital. One of these craftsmen was
Alonso Rodriguez the younger, who, on June 7th,
1574, sold to a canon of the cathedral ten
thousand white and green tiles of a common kind
(<i>ladrillos</i>), probably employed for roofing. The
price was three ducats the thousand. On April
10th, 1598, Juan Sanchez engaged to supply the
same temple with the same quantity of glazed
tiles (<i>tejas</i>) for roofing, coloured white, green, and
yellow, at sixteen <i>maravedis</i> each tile.</p>

<p><i>Azulejos</i> were certainly made at Granada in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and probably
earlier.</p>

<p class="caption">LVI<br />THE GATE OF WINE<br />
(<i>Showing polychrome tiling. Alhambra, Granada</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>In a passage of the Alhambra palace leading
from the Patio de la Alberca to the Cuarto Dorado,
a space was laid bare not many years ago,
containing the original <i>mostagueras</i> or small tiles
used for flooring, glazed in two colours; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
same building, although in constantly diminishing
quantities, are large numbers of tiles which date
from the time of the Spanish Moors. There has
been a good deal of discussion as to whether the
roofs of the Alhambra were originally covered with
decorative tiles. Swinburne (who must not, however,
be taken as the safest of authorities) wrote
that &ldquo;in Moorish times the building was covered
with large painted and glazed tiles, of which some
few are yet to be seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indifferent Renaissance tiles, made in the reign
of Philip the Fifth, are still preserved in parts of
the Alhambra.</p>

<p>Excellent polychrome <i>cuerda seca</i> tiles (fourteenth
century), in white, green, yellow, blue, and
black, are over the horseshoe archway of the Gate
of Wine of the Alhambra (Plate <a href="#img_154.jpg">lvi</a>.). According
to Gómez Moreno,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> they were manufactured here,
as were the Moorish <i>azulejos</i>, yellow, black, white,
violet, and sky-blue, in the Mirador de Daraxa.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The archives of the Moorish palace also state
that towards the close of the sixteenth century
Antonio Tenorio, whose pottery was situated
in the Secano, and consequently within a stone's-throw
of the Casa Real, made several sets of
<i>azulejos</i> for the Hall of the Abencerrajes. Good
Morisco tiles, dating from the same period and
wrought by craftsmen such as Gaspar Hernandez,
Pedro Tenorio, and the members of the Robles
family, are in the Sala de Comares, and in one of
the rooms of the Casa de los Tiros.</p>

<p>From the thirteenth century until the eighteenth,
excellent <i>azulejos</i> were made in Cataluña. Specimens
of every period exist in the collections of
Don Francisco Rogent and Don José Font y
Gumá, of Barcelona, and Don Luis Santacana,
of Martorell. The tiles belonging to these
gentlemen proceed from the cathedral and other
temples of Barcelona, and from the monasteries
or castles of Poblet, Santas Creus, Montserrat,
Marmellá, San Miguel de Ervol, Centellas, Torre
Pallaresa, San Miguel del Fay, and Vallpellach.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Another region which has long been celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
for its <i>azulejeria</i> is the kingdom of Valencia.
Even in the eighteenth century, when this craft
was generally in a state of great decadence,
Valencian tiles were thoroughly well made,
although the patterns on them were defective.
Laborde pronounced them &ldquo;the best executed
and most elegant in Europe,&rdquo; and further said
of this locality; &ldquo;the painted earthenware tiles
or <i>azulejos</i> are used in the country, but only a
small part of them; a great many are sent into
the interior of Spain as well as to Cadiz, where
they are shipped for Spanish America, and to
Marseilles, whence they are conveyed into Africa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same writer inserts an interesting account
of the manufacture of these <i>azulejos</i>. &ldquo;It is at
Valencia that the tiles of earthenware are made,
with which they incrust walls and pave apartments:
those tiles are of a clayey earth, which is
found in the territories of Quarte near Valencia;
they harden the earth long after soaking it in
water; the tiles are formed in moulds, and are
dried in the sun; they are then beaten with a
piece of square wood of the dimensions of which
they are wanted. They are then put into the oven,
where they undergo a slight baking. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
they are done they are glazed, and are afterwards
painted in water colours with whatever subject
is intended to be represented. The tiles are
then replaced in the oven so as not to touch one
another, and that the action of the fire may
penetrate them all equally: as the colours change
by baking, the workmen apply them anew in
proportion to the changes that take place; the
red alone alters entirely. The varnish with
which they are glazed is made with lead, tin, and
white sand. These three substances are ground
in a mill to powder, which is mixed with water,
to form a paste, and baked in the oven; it is
again pounded and put into the oven, where it
crystallises: being once more reduced to powder
and diluted with water, it becomes varnish.
There are two kinds of it; one is whiter than
the other, though the same materials are used:
the mode of mixing alone makes the difference;
the whiter, the clearer the tiles. It takes a certain
number of tiles to form a picture: they are of
different dimensions; the smallest are three inches
nine lines, the largest seven inches nine lines.
The price varies according to the size of the
tile, the beauty of the varnish, and the variety of
the drawings: the lowest price is eight pesos
(25s.) a thousand, and the highest 100 pesos or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
£15, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> There is a considerable demand
for them; they are superior both in beauty and
strength to those used in Holland.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">LVII<br />TILES OF THE DECADENT PERIOD</p>
</div>

<p>Bourgoing, author of the <i>Nouveau Voyage en
Espagne</i>, described, in 1789, the same product in
the following terms: &ldquo;L'industrie des Valenciens
tire d'ailleurs parti de toutes les productions de
leur sol. Il contient une espèce de terre dont ils
font ces carreaux de faïence colorée, connus sous
le nom d'<i>Azulejos</i>, et qu'on ne fabrique qu'à
Valence. On en pave les appartements, et on en
revêt leurs lambris; on y peint les sujets les plus
compliqués, tels par exemple qu'un bal masqué,
une fête de taureaux. La couleur rouge est la
seule qui ne puisse être fixée sur cette espèce de
faïence; elle s'altere entièrement par la cuisson.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>For the amusement of my readers, I insert an
illustration of common Spanish tiles of the decadent
period (Plate <a href="#img_158.jpg">lvii</a>.), displaying considerable
liveliness combined with reckless ignorance of
draughtsmanship. A class of these degenerate
tiles, made in large quantities at Seville in the
eighteenth century, is known as <i>azulejos de
montería</i> or &ldquo;hunting-tiles,&rdquo; since episodes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
chase form one of the favourite themes of their
design.</p>

<p>Although it passed through a long period of
prostration, embracing the greater part of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, at no time
has the manufacture of decorative Spanish tiles
succumbed completely. Of recent years it has
revived surprisingly at Seville, Barcelona, and
Segovia; and at the first of these cities the older
<i>azulejos</i>, and particularly those in the <i>cuenca</i> style,
are imitated to perfection.</p>

<p>In the cheapest kinds of modern tiling, such as
is used for corridors and kitchens, a common device
is a series of repeated curves and dots which
evidently has its source in Arabic lettering.
Indeed, the ornamental and attractive written
characters of the Spanish Moors, rendered familiar
to their rivals through long centuries of intercourse,
seem to have constantly found favour with the
Christian Spaniards. The <i>fuero</i> of Jaca, dated
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1064, tells us that a Christian prince of Spain,
Don Sancho Ramirez, was accustomed to write
his signature in Arabic lettering. Meaningless
inscriptions in the same language, and evidently
executed by a Christian hand, are engraved on
objects in the Royal Armoury; and Señor Osma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
describes in an interesting pamphlet (<i>Los letreros
ornamentales en la cerámica morisca del Siglo XV.</i>)
how, in the pottery of older Spain, a word in Arabic
such as <i>alafia</i> (&ldquo;prosperity&rdquo; or &ldquo;blessing&rdquo;) would
often be corrupted by Morisco craftsmen into a
motive of a purely ornamental character, and
which would only in this sense be comprehended
and appreciated by the Christian.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<h3>HISPANO-MORESQUE LUSTRED POTTERY</h3>

<p>Probably no pottery in the world possesses
greater loveliness or interest than the celebrated,
yet even to this day mysterious, lustred ware of
Moorish Spain. Our knowledge of the early
history of this ware is still imperfect. In modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
times, attention was first drawn to the lustre
process by M. Riocreux, of the Sèvres Museum.
In spite, however, of the subsequent monographs
and researches of Davillier and other authorities,
the origin of lustred pottery is yet a problem which
awaits solution. Until some years ago it was
believed to have had its source in Persia, where
many specimens have been discovered in the form
of tiles and other objects; but this belief was
afterwards shaken by Fouquet, who unearthed at
Fostat in Egypt, in the year 1884, specimens of
lustred ware which are known to date from the
eleventh century. Saladin, too, affirms that he
has seen upon the mosque of Kairuan lustred
plaques with inscriptions recording them to have
been presented, between <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 864 and 875, by the
emir Ibrahim Ahmed-ibn-el-Aglab.</p>

<p>Whatever these facts may signify, it appears
from a statement by the geographer Edrisi that
lustred ware was made in Spain as early as the
twelfth century. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the writer, speaking
of Calatayud, &ldquo;is produced the gold-coloured
pottery which is exported to all countries.&rdquo; The
next allusion to it is by the traveller Ibn-Batutah,
who visited certain parts of Spain in the middle
of the fourteenth century. &ldquo;At Málaga,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
wrote, &ldquo;is made the beautiful golden pottery which
is exported to the farthest countries.&rdquo; These
passages refer respectively to Aragon and Andalusia.
The same ware was produced in Murcia.
Ibn-Said, quoted by Al-Makkari, mentions the
&ldquo;glazed and gilded porcelain&rdquo; of Murcia, Málaga,
and Almería, calling it &ldquo;strange and admirable.&rdquo;
It was also manufactured, probably in larger
quantities than in any other part of Spain, in many
towns and villages of the kingdom of Valencia,
such as Carcer, Alaquaz, Moncada, Quarte, Villalonga,
Traiguera, and Manises. In the <i>Excellencies
of the Kingdom of Valencia</i>, written by Eximenes
and published in 1499, we find it stated that
&ldquo;surpassing everything else is the ware of Manises,
gilded and painted with such mastery that all the
world is enamoured thereof, insomuch that the
pope, the cardinals, and princes send for it,
astonished that objects of such excellence can be
made of earth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Other writers on the same locality, such as Diago
and Escolano, author of the <i>Historia de la insigne</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
<i>y coronada ciudad y reino de Valencia</i> (Valencia,
1610, 1611), confirm this eulogy of Eximenes.
According to Escolano, Valencian ware was &ldquo;of
such loveliness that in return for that which the
Italians send us from Pisa, we send them boatloads
of it from Manises.&rdquo; One of the most recent of
authorities on lustred ware remarks that &ldquo;in the
fifteenth century ornamental vases in the (Spanish-Moorish)
wares appear to have been commanded
from Spain by wealthy Florentines, as is evident
from the Medici arms and impresa in fig. 40;
others bearing the Florentine lily (fig. 41) seem
to have been ordered from the same city.&rdquo; The
illustrations to which the author of this monograph<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
refers, depict a vase and a boccale, both
in lustred ware, and which it is extremely probable
were manufactured at Manises.</p>

<p>The same ware was also possibly made in
Cataluña, where pieces of it have been found
among the ruins of the village of Las Casas. <i>La
Alhambra</i>, a small magazine which is published
at Granada, contains, in the number dated
September 30th, 1901, an account of these fragments
by their finder, Joaquín Vilaplana.</p>

<p>Some years ago the Balearic Islands were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
thought to have produced this pottery. One of
the earliest and most fervent champions of this
theory, now definitely shown to be erroneous,
was Baron Davillier. This gentleman, in some
respects an excellent authority on Spanish ceramics,
relied too strongly on certain assurances
made him by a Señor Bover, and ended by declaring
that in the museums of Paris and London
he had himself seen lustred plates which bore the
arms of Ynca in the Balearics, proving them to
have been manufactured at that town.</p>

<p>However, a Majorcan archæologist, named Alvaro
Campaner, refuted one by one Davillier's
points of argument, and showed beyond all
question that both the plates of Ynca and the
arms which decorated them were simply nonexistent,
and that the term <i>Majolica</i>, deriving
from <i>Majorica</i>, applies to pottery in general,
and not with any preference to lustred ware.
Campaner also suggested very ingeniously that
the word <i>Majolica</i> was probably applied by the
Italians to Catalan or Valencian pottery conveyed
to Italy in vessels themselves belonging to the
Balearics, and which were in the habit of completing
their cargoes in the ports of Barcelona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and Valencia, and he added that this suggestion
is supported by the fact that specimens of lustred
ware are far more often met with on the Balearic
coast than in the towns and villages of the interior.
It is only fair to state that Davillier frankly and
fully recognized the value of Campaner's refutation.</p>

<p>As to the methods of producing lustred pottery,
the chemical investigations practised by Riocreux,
Brogniart, Carand, and others, have shown that
the metals used to produce the characteristic reflex
which gives the ware its name were copper and
silver, entering into the composition of an extremely
thin glaze extended over the surface of
the pottery, and employed, sometimes together,
and sometimes separately. It is obvious that the
lustre produced by copper would be deeper, redder,
and less delicate than that produced by silver,
while varying gradations would be obtainable by
the mixture of both metals. It is also beyond
doubt that the oldest specimens of this pottery
extant to-day are those which contain the palest
and most pearly lustre, and consequently the
largest quantity of the costlier metal. In those
of later date there is an evident inferiority, both
in colour, lustre, and design. In fact, two
separate, or nearly separate, epochs of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
branch of Spanish pottery are pointed out by
Señor Mélida, who gives the name of <i>Mudejar</i>
to lustred objects manufactured at an earlier time
by Moorish artists working in the cities captured
by the Christians, and that of <i>Morisco</i> to the
second or inferior class produced by Morisco
craftsmen after the reconquest, and distinguished
by the coarser and degenerate lustre, colouring,
and draughtsmanship.</p>

<p>The rarest and most beautiful examples of this
ware are naturally those which belong to the
former class, and consist of various kinds of plates
and other objects in which elaborate devices such
as lions, antelopes, and shields of heraldry, often
combined with foliage and inscriptions in Gothic
lettering, are coloured in bistre or pale blue,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and
rendered doubly beautiful by the delicate nacreous
lustre.</p>

<p>In nearly every case it is extremely difficult to
determine with any certainty the date of manufacture
of these objects, as well as the locality.
Wallis says he is aware of &ldquo;no example of Spanish
lustre pottery antecedent to those in the class to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
which the large Palermo jar belongs, and they
are not likely to be much earlier than the end of
the fourteenth century. Happily the celebrated
plaque (Plate <a href="#img_168.jpg">lviii</a>.) formerly belonging to Fortuny,
and now in the possession of Excmo Sr. Don G. J.
de Osma, furnishes an early date, which,
according to its owner, is between May 1408
and November 1417. Those who know the
original will remember that it is no less remarkable
for the quality of its golden lustre than for
the grace and elegance of its fanciful Oriental
design.&rdquo; It is also believed by Señor Osma that
this plaque was manufactured in the kingdom of
Granada; <i>i.e.</i> either at Granada or Málaga.</p>

<p>A specimen of Spanish lustred ware more
celebrated even than Fortuny's plaque is the
&ldquo;vase of the Alhambra&rdquo; (Plate <a href="#img_170.jpg">lix</a>.), which rests
to-day in a corner of the Sala de las Dos Hermanas.
The history of this mighty jar is
interesting. Popular superstition affirms it to
have been discovered, filled to the brim with
gold, by the Marquis of Mondejar, first of the
Christian governors of the fortress of Granada.
Exposed for many years to every stress of weather
and to every mutilation at the hands of passers-by,
it stood, in company with other vases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
enormous size, upon a rampart which is now the
garden terrace known as the Adarves. Several
of the older travellers have described these vessels
or alluded to them. Marmol wrote of them as
far back as the sixteenth century, while the
journal of Bertaut de Rouen contains the following
notice;&mdash;&ldquo;Sur la première terrasse par où l'on
entre, et d'où l'on a de la peine à regarder en
bas sans estre ébloüy, il y a deux fontaines jaillissantes,
et tout du long des murs du chasteau, des
espaliers d'orangers et de grenadiers, avec de
grands vases de terre peinte, aussi belle que la
porcelaine, où il n'y avoit pour lors, sinon quelques
fleurs en quelques-uns: mais où l'on dit que le
Marquis de Mondejar trouva quantité d'or que les
Mores avaient caché dans la terre, quand il y fût
estably par Ferdinand.&rdquo; The priest Echeverría,
who forged the relics of the ancient Alcazaba of
Granada,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> was careful to repeat this fable in the
twenty-sixth chapter of his <i>Paseos por Granada</i>.
The first edition of this work was published in
1764, under the assumed name of Joseph Romero
Yranzo. There were then two vases and part of
a third, all &ldquo;lacerated, peeled, and maltreated.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
The Englishman Swinburne wrote in 1776 that
below the Towers of the Bell, &ldquo;on the south-side,
on a slip of terrace, is the governor's garden, a
very pleasant walk, full of fine orange and cypress
trees and myrtle hedges, but quite abandoned.
The view it commands is incomparable. Two
large vases enamelled with gold and azure foliages
and characters are the only ornaments left: these
were taken out of the vaults under the royal apartments.&rdquo;
In the second edition of Echeverría's
<i>Paseos</i>, which was republished in 1814, it is
added in a footnote that only a single vase
remained, &ldquo;in a room that overlooks the Court of
Myrtles.&rdquo; Lozano, however, in his <i>Antigüedades
Arabes</i>, mentions two vases as existing at the
same period. Argote de Molina (<i>Nuevos Paseos
por Granada</i>, published about 1808) describes,
together with the wretchedly executed marble
statues in the Sala de las Ninfas, the &ldquo;two or
three great porcelain jars whereof some pieces
only now remain,&rdquo; and reminds us that according
to the old tradition these statues looked continually
towards the vases, which were full of treasure.
Argote, nevertheless, takes Echeverría sharply to
task for his absurdities upon this theme; and
Washington Irving, a diligent gleaner in Echeverría's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
somewhat scanty field, makes use of the
same material for his well-known story.</p>

</div>

<p>In the time of Owen Jones the one surviving
vase, now standing with a wooden rail before it
in a corner of the Hall of the Two Sisters, still
occupied the &ldquo;room that looks upon the Court of
Myrtles.&rdquo; Jones wrote of it in 1842:&mdash;&ldquo;This
beautiful vase was discovered, it is said, full of
gold in one of the subterranean chambers of the
Casa Real. It is at present to be seen in a small
chamber of the Court of the Fish-pond, in which
are deposited the archives of the palace. It is
engraved in the Spanish work by Lozano,
<i>Antigüedades Arabes de España</i>, with another of
the same size, which was broken a few years ago,
and the pieces sold to a passing traveller. The
vase is executed in baked clay, with enamelled
colours and gold similar to the mosaics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A more precise description is the following.
The vase, which measures four feet six inches in
height by eight feet two inches and a half in
circumference, is of common earthenware painted
with intricate devices fired after painting. This
was a difficult operation in a vessel of such size;
and here, in consequence, the colours have slightly
run and mingled. Besides these technical flaws,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the belly of the vase is broken clean in half, and
one of the handles is missing. The shape is
amphoraic, with a moderate downward curve.
About the middle, surrounded by leaf and stem
and geometrical devices effectively intertwined,
are two antelopes. The vase is coloured blue
and caramel upon a delicate yellow ground, and
has a faint metallic lustre.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> An Arabic inscription
is repeated several times, and consists of the
words &ldquo;Felicity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This vase is believed to date from the fourteenth
century; and if we judge from the colour
and composition of the earth employed, it appears
probable that it was made at Granada. Together
with the other vases which have disappeared,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> it
was doubtless meant to serve as a receptacle for
water, and for decorating the chambers of the
palace, where it would rest in amphora-fashion
on a perforated stand, while smaller vases containing
flowers would fill the niches which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
yet be seen in various inner walls of the Alhambra.
The belief of Argote<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and many other writers
that these niches were intended to receive the
slippers of the Moors is utterly unfounded.</p>

<p>Until quite recently all published illustrations
of the great <i>jarrón de la Alhambra</i> were inaccurate,
and as a rule grotesquely so. Among
the very worst are those inserted in the handbooks
of Riaño and Contreras. I am glad to be
able to reproduce an excellent photograph, which
both corrects the atrocious cuts I have observed
elsewhere, and relieves me from giving a prolix
and possibly a wearisome description of the
decoration on the vase.</p>

<p>Several other lustred vases of large size are
still preserved in Spain and other countries. One,
proceeding from a Sicilian church, is in the
museum of Palermo. Wallis, who inserts an
illustration, describes it as &ldquo;amphora-shaped, with
two large flat handles; pear-shaped body, long
neck, ribbed at lower part, canellated above,
moulded lip. Whitish body, tin glaze. Ornament
painted in gold lustre on white ground,
the pattern in parts almost obliterated. Hispano-Moresque.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Height, one metre, seventeen centimetres.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another of these great vases belonged to the
painter Fortuny, and was sold at his death to
Prince Basilewsky, for thirty thousand francs. It
was found by Fortuny at the village of Salar,
near Granada, and purchased by him at a low
price. &ldquo;The neck and mouth resemble those of
the Alhambra vase. The ornamentation is distributed
about the body of the vase in four zones;
one of the two central zones has tangent circles,
and the other an inscription.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Another large lustred vase is in the museum of
Madrid (Plate <a href="#img_172.jpg">lx</a>.). It was found by a labourer
at Hornos in the province of Jaen, and passed
into the hands of the village priest, who placed it
in his church to support the font of holy water.
In course of time a dealer in antiquities, by name
Amat, happened to pass that way, observed the
vase, and made an offer for it to the <i>padre</i>. This
latter at first refused, but subsequently, stimulated
by an ignorant though well-intentioned and disinterested
zeal for bettering the temple, he stipulated
that if the dealer provided a new support
of marble for the font, and paid for white washing
the church, he might bear off the coveted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<i>jarrón</i>. Fulfilling these conditions at all speed, he
mounted the precious vessel on an ass, and briskly
strode away. When he had gone a little distance
the villagers, missing their cherished vase, though
unaware, of course, of its artistic worth, swarmed
angrily about the purchaser, flourished their knives
and sticks at him, and pelted him with stones. At
this he called upon the mayor for protection; the
mayor provided him with two armed men for bodyguard,
and, thus defended, the indomitable dealer
reached Madrid and sold his jar to government
for fifteen hundred dollars. Its present value is
estimated at not less than thirty thousand.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>One of the earliest and most interesting notices
relating to the preparation of this lustred ware is
contained in a description by one of the royal
archers, named Henry Cock, of the progress,
performed in 1585, of Philip the Second from the
court of Spain to Zaragoza.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Cock wrote of Muel,
in Aragon:&mdash;&ldquo;Almost all the inhabitants of this
village are potters, and all the earthenware sold
at Zaragoza is made in the following manner.
The vessels are first fashioned to the required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
shape from a certain substance extracted from the
earth of this locality. They are next baked in a
specially constructed oven, and when removed
from this are varnished with white varnish and
polished, after which they are washed with a
mixture of twenty-five pounds of lead, three or
four pounds of tin, and as many pounds of a
certain sand which is found there. All these
ingredients are mixed into a paste resembling ice,
which is broken small, pounded like flour, and
kept in powder. This powder is mixed with
water, the dishes are passed through it, and after
being rebaked they keep their lustre. Next, in
order to gild the pottery, they take the strongest
vinegar mixed with about two <i>reales</i> of powdered
silver, vermilion, and red ochre, and a little wire.
When all is thoroughly mixed they paint the
patterns on the dishes with a feather, bake them
again, and their gold colour is now quite permanent.
I was told all this by the potters
themselves.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another most interesting account of the manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of lustred ware was discovered in manuscript
by Riaño in the British Museum, and,
although it belongs to a later date (1785), is well
worth quoting fully. It consists of a report upon
the later gilded pottery of Manises, and was drawn
up by order of the Count of Floridablanca:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the pottery is baked, it is varnished with
white and blue, the only colours used besides the
gold lustre; the vessels are again baked; if the
objects are to be painted with gold colour, this
can only be put on the white varnish, after they
have gone twice through the oven. The vessels
are then painted with the said gold colour and
are baked a third time, with only dry rosemary
for fuel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The white varnish used is composed of lead
and tin, which are melted together in an oven
made on purpose; after these materials are
sufficiently melted, they become like earth, and
when in this state the mixture is removed and
mixed with an equal quantity in weight of sand:
fine salt is added to it, it is boiled again, and when
cold, pounded into powder. The only sand which
can be used is from a cave at Benalguacil, three
leagues from Manises. In order that the varnish
should be fine, for every <i>arroba</i>, twenty-five pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of lead, six to twelve ounces of tin must be added,
and half a bushel of finely-powdered salt: if a
coarse kind is required, it is sufficient to add a very
small quantity of tin, and three or four <i>cuartos</i>
worth of salt, which in this case must be added
when the ingredient is ready for varnishing the
vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five ingredients enter into the composition of
the gold colour: copper, which is better the older
it is; silver, as old as possible; sulphur; red
ochre; and strong vinegar, which are mixed in
the following proportions: of copper three ounces,
of red ochre twelve ounces, of silver one <i>peseta</i>
(about a shilling), sulphur three ounces, vinegar
a quart; three pounds (of twelve ounces) of the
earth or scoriæ, which is left after this pottery is
painted with the gold colour, is added to the
other ingredients.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_178.jpg" width="500" height="381"
        alt="see caption"
        title="see caption" />
        <a name="img_178.jpg" id="img_178.jpg"></a>
<p class="caption">LXIII<br />HISPANO-MORESQUE LUSTRED WARE<br />
(<i>A.D. 1460-1480. Osma Collection</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;They are mixed in the following manner: a
small portion of sulphur in powder is put into a
casserole with two small bits of copper, between
them a coin of one silver <i>peseta</i>; the rest of the
sulphur and copper is then added to it. When
this casserole is ready, it is placed on the fire, and
is made to boil until the sulphur is consumed,
which is evident when no flame issues from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
The preparation is then taken from the fire, and
when cold is pounded very fine; the red ochre
and scoriæ are then added to it; it is mixed up
by hand and again pounded into powder. The
preparation is placed in a basin and mixed with
enough water to make a sufficient paste to stick
on the sides of the basin; the mixture is then
rubbed on the vessel with a stick; it is therefore
indispensable that the water should be added very
gradually until the mixture is in the proper state.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The basin ready prepared must be placed in
an oven for six hours. At Manises it is customary
to do so when the vessels of common pottery are
baked; after this the mixture is scratched off
the sides of the basin with some iron instrument;
it is then removed from there and broken up into
small pieces, which are pounded fine in a hand-mortar
with the quantity of vinegar already
mentioned, and after having been well ground
and pounded together for two hours the mixture
is ready for decorating. It is well to observe
that the quantity of varnish and gold-coloured
mixture which is required for every object can
only be ascertained by practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the gilded ware of the kingdom
of Valencia had by this time deteriorated very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
greatly. Formerly, from as far back as the reign
of Jayme the Conqueror, the other towns or
villages of this region which produced the lustred
and non-lustred pottery were Játiva, Paterna,
Quarte, Villalonga, Alaqua, Carcer, and Moncada.
Early in the fourteenth century fourteen potteries
were working in the town of Biar, and twenty-three
at Traiguera. Manises, however, maintained
the lead for many years. The notices of
Eximenes and other writers concerning the pottery
of this town have been already quoted. The
same ware is mentioned in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries by Diago (1613), Francisco
Jávier Borrell, Beuter, and Martin de Viciana.
Marineus Siculus, the chronicler of Ferdinand
and Isabella, adds that similar or identical pottery
(&ldquo;<i>desta misma arte</i>&rdquo;) was made in Murcia, whose
manufacture of it had been praised in earlier
times by Ibn-Said. Toledo also manufactured
gilded ware with blue or bistre colouring. García
Llansó says that in the sixteenth century this
capital produced plates which contain the arms of
Spain in the centre, the rest of the plate being
completely covered with minute geometrical or
floral ornamentation.</p>

<p class="caption">LXIV<br />HISPANO-MORESQUE LUSTRED WARE<br />
(<i>A.D. 1460-1480. Osma Collection</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>It is certain that during the fourteenth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
fifteenth centuries large quantities of lustred
pottery were produced in many parts of Andalusia,
Castile, Aragon, and Valencia. The oldest and
most valuable specimens of this pottery are those
which have the palest and most purely golden
lustre, combined with blue or bluish decoration in
the form of animals, coats of arms, or foliage.
The lustred ware of Manises began to deteriorate
about the time of the expulsion of the Moriscos,
when the leaves and fronds of a clean gold tone
upon a lightish ground are replaced by commoner
and coarser patterns, and the gold itself by the
coppery lustre which is still employed.</p>

<p>After the seventeenth century the further decline
of this once famous industry may be traced
from the accounts of travellers. Towards the
middle of this century Bowles wrote that &ldquo;two
leagues from the capital (Valencia) is a fair-looking
town of only four streets, whose occupants are
nearly all potters. They make a <i>copper-coloured</i>
ware of great beauty, <i>used for common purposes and
for decorating the houses of the working-people
of the province</i>. They make this ware of an
argillaceous earth resembling in its colour and
composition that portion of the soil of Valencia
which produces native mercury&hellip;. The objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
they fashion of this earth possess a glitter and are
very inexpensive, since I purchased half a dozen
plates for a <i>real</i>. Nevertheless, <i>this is not the
ware which has the highest reputation in the kingdom
of Valencia</i>. The factory which the Count of
Aranda has established at Alcora is not surpassed
in Europe, and is ahead of many in fineness of
substance, hardness of the varnish, and elegance
of form. It would be perfect of its kind if the
varnish did not crack and peel off so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Laborde, early in the nineteenth
century Manises contained two potteries &ldquo;of considerable
extent, which employ seventy workmen.
The people occupied in these possess the art of
producing a gold <i>bronze</i> colour which they carefully
keep a secret, never communicating it to any
person.&rdquo; Elsewhere in the same book Laborde
is more explicit. &ldquo;Manises is a village situated a
league and a quarter north of Valencia. It is
seen on the left coming from New Castile. It is
noted for its manufactories of earthen ware, which
employ thirty kilns, and occupy a great part of the
inhabitants. The women are employed in forming
the designs and applying the colours. There are
two large manufactories of a superior kind, the
earthen ware of which is tolerably fine, of a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
white, and a moderate price. They also make
here vases worked with a great degree of delicacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The society of these workmen possess the
secret of the composition of a colour which in the
fire takes the tint and brightness of a beautiful
gilt <i>bronze</i>. It has been unsuccessfully attempted
to be imitated; the heads of the society compose
the colour themselves, and distribute it to the
masters who take care of it; it is a liquid of the
colour of Spanish tobacco, but a little deeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quantity of Hispano-Moresque lustred
pottery preserved in the public and private collections
of various countries is far from small, although
to classify it according to the place and date of its
production is nearly always a matter of extreme
difficulty.</p>

<p>Among the earliest specimens are the vase
of the Alhambra, those which are now in the
museums of Palermo and Madrid, that which
belonged to Fortuny, and the plaque which once
was also his, and now forms part of the Osma
collection. Lustred Spanish tiles are scarce. A
few exist at Seville<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and Granada, chiefly in altar-fronts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
along the archivolts of doorways, or, with
heraldic motives, on the inner walls of houses
of the aristocracy. Invariably, says Gestoso,
such tiles are coloured with combinations of white,
blue, and gold, since in the lustre process other
colours&mdash;black, or green, or deepish yellow&mdash;proved
unsatisfactory. Other lustred tiles of
exquisite beauty are owned by Señor Osma,
(Plate <a href="#img_174.jpg">lxi</a>.), and seem to have even gained in
brilliance by the centuries that have passed over
them. Riaño gives a list of the specimens of this
pottery which are at South Kensington, consisting
of bowls, vases, and plates. One of the vases is
particularly beautiful. It dates from the fifteenth
century, and is described by Fortnum as having
&ldquo;a spherical body on a trumpet-shaped base, with
a neck of elongated funnel form, flanked by two
large wing-shaped handles perforated with circular
holes. The surface, except the mouldings,
is entirely covered with a diaper-pattern of ivy
or briony leaves, tendrils, and small flowers in
brownish lustre and blue on the white ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Señor Osma I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
able to give illustrations of a few of the finest
specimens of lustred ware in his magnificent
collection (Plates <a href="#img_176.jpg">lxii</a>.&ndash;<a href="#img_184.jpg">lxvi</a>.). The three small
vessels facing pages 176, 178, and 180 are of
Valencian workmanship, and date, according to
their owner, from between 1460 and 1480. The
two plates are also Valencian. The one with a
bull in the centre dates from between 1480 and
1500; and that which has a greyhound from
slightly earlier&mdash;say 1470 to 1490.</p>

<h3>POTTERY OF SEVILLE, PUENTE DEL ARZOBISPO,
TALAVERA DE LA REINA, TOLEDO, AND BARCELONA;
POROUS WARE; PORCELAIN OF ALCORA
AND THE ROYAL FACTORY OF THE BUEN RETIRO.</h3>

<p>We have seen that Seville was an early and
important centre of the potter's craft in Spain.
Her potteries were celebrated even with the
Romans, and probably have at no moment been
inactive. Fifty, established in the suburb of
Triana, were mentioned in the sixteenth century
by Pedro de Medina, and documents which tell
of many more have recently been discovered by
Gestoso. The excellence of the Seville tiles has
been described in a preceding section of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
chapter. Their production still continues upon
a large scale; and the ware of the Cartuja factory,
which reached the zenith of its fame towards the
end of the eighteenth century, is considered by
Jacquemart and other authorities to rival with the
Italian wares of Savona.</p>

<p>Pottery made in other parts of the Peninsula&mdash;particularly
that of Talavera de la Reina&mdash;is
known to have been imitated by the Seville potters
with embarrassing perfection. In the case of the
so-called &ldquo;loza de Puente del Arzobispo,&rdquo; it is
the Seville ware itself which seems to have been
imitated. Puente del Arzobispo is a small village
near Toledo. Mendez wrote of it in the seventeenth
century:&mdash;&ldquo;Fine pottery is manufactured in
about eight kilns, which produce more than 40,000
ducats yearly.&rdquo; &ldquo;In 1755,&rdquo; says Riaño, &ldquo;thirteen
pottery kilns existed at this place; they still
worked in 1791, but their productions were very
inferior in artistic merit.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">LXVII<br />HISPANO-MORESQUE LUSTRED WARE</p>
</div>

<p>Not many years ago the name of Puente del
Arzobispo was connected by Baron Davillier with
certain polychrome non-lustred plates and other
vessels which are greatly esteemed for their rarity,
and of which a few specimens exist in the South
Kensington and other museums, as well as in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
or two private collections, such as that of Señor
Osma.</p>

<p>Gestoso says that the usual diameter of these
plates is either twenty-three centimetres or forty-two
centimetres. &ldquo;Their decoration, betraying
at a glance the Saracenic influence, consists of
leaves and flowers, together with animals of a
more or less fantastic character: lions, rabbits,
and birds. In other specimens the centre is
occupied by a heart, fleurs-de-lis, or other fancy
devices, or yet, in some few cases, with the head
of a man or woman. These central designs are
surrounded with leaves and flowers. The draughtsmanship
upon these plates is of the rudest, and
the process of their colouring was as follows.
The figures were drawn upon the unfired surface
in manganese ink mixed with a greasy substance;
and after this the aqueous enamel or glaze was
allowed to drop from a hogshair brush into the
spaces which the black had outlined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This will be recognized as the <i>cuerda seca</i> process,
so extensively employed in making Seville
tiles. Nevertheless, judging by certain marks upon
this pottery, Baron Davillier declared it to proceed
from Puente del Arzobispo. The marks in
question consist in one or two examples of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
appears to be the letters A.P. or P.A.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Davillier,
however, affirmed that he had seen a plate fully
inscribed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_188a.jpg" width="347" height="350"
        alt="inscription"
        title="inscription" />
</div>

<p>The existence of this plate is now discredited; at
least, no trace of it can be discovered at this day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Upon the other hand, Gestoso points to various
objects manufactured by the <i>cuerda seca</i> method,
and which undoubtedly proceed from Seville.
Among them are three shields, one of which,
containing the arms of Ferdinand and Isabella,
is of exceptional interest, for it is accompanied by
an inscribed slab, evidently coeval with the shield
itself, recording it to have been made in the year
1503, and by Jerónimo Suarez. This shield and
slab were removed from a courtyard of the old
Alhóndiga to Seville Museum, where they now
remain. Of the two other shields, one belongs
to Señor Osma, and the second, which is still at
Seville, adorns the tomb of Don León Enriquez
in the church of Santa Paula; and since it is unquestionable
that all these <i>cuerda seca</i> shields,
as well as quantities of <i>cuerda seca</i> tiles, were
made at Seville, Gestoso prudently suggests that
we should designate as &ldquo;<i>cuerda seca</i> ware&rdquo; that
pottery which has hitherto passed as specially
belonging to Puente del Arzobispo. In fact,
towards the end of the fifteenth century this
pottery is found extending northward from Seville
to Toledo, and Señor Osma assures me that Toledo
specimens are of a somewhat later manufacture
than those which were produced at Seville. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the rarest and most interesting <i>cuerda seca</i>
plates in this gentleman's collection is reproduced
herewith (lxviii.). No other plate of similar
pattern is known to exist. Its date may be
placed between 1480 and 1495, and it gives a
curious illustration of the masculine headdress and
headwear in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p>The pottery of Talavera de la Reina was at
one time much esteemed. The earliest mention
of it, says Riaño, occurs in 1560, in a manuscript
history of this town, while another notice, dated
1576, says that here was produced &ldquo;fine white
glazed earthenware and other pottery, which
supplied the country, part of Portugal, and India.&rdquo;
More explicit are the observations of Father
Alonso de Ajofrín, who wrote, in 1651, a history
of Talavera. He says that &ldquo;her pottery is as
good as that of Pisa, while quantities of <i>azulejos</i>
are made here to adorn the front of altars,
churches, gardens, alcoves, saloons, and bowers,
and large and small specimens of every kind.
Two hundred workmen work at eight separate
kilns. Four other kilns produce the commoner
kinds of ware. Red porous clay vessels and
drinking-cups are baked in two other kilns in
a thousand shapes to imitate birds and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
creatures; also <i>brinquiños</i> for the use of ladies, so
deliciously flavoured that after drinking the water
they contained, they eat the cup in which it was
brought them.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The following most interesting notice relating
to this town is also quoted by Riaño: &ldquo;The
earthenware pottery made here has reached a
great perfection; it is formed of white and red
clay. Vases, cups, <i>bucaros</i> and <i>brinquiños</i> are
made of different kinds, dishes and table centres,
and imitations of snails, owls, dogs, and every
kind of fruits, olives, and almonds. These objects
are painted with great perfection, and the imitations
of porcelain brought from the Portuguese
Indies are most excellent. Everyone is surprised
that in so small a town such excellent things
should be made. The varnish used for the
white pottery is made with tin and sand, and
is now found to be more acceptable than coloured
earthenware; so much so, that persons of importance
who pass by this town, although they
have in their houses dinner-services of silver,
buy earthenware made at Talavera, on account
of its excellence. The sand which was used
to make the white varnish was brought from
Hita, and is now found at Mejorada, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Talavera. This sand is as fine and soft as
silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The red pottery made at Talavera is much
to be commended, for besides the great variety of
objects, and the different medals which they place
upon them, they have invented some small
<i>brinquiños</i> of so small and delicate a kind, that
the ladies wear them. Rosaries are also made of
the same material. A certain scent is added in
the manufacture of this pottery which excites the
appetite and taste of the women, who eat the
pottery so frequently that it gives great trouble to
their confessors to check this custom.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>This porous pottery for keeping water cool
had been imported from America, and was chiefly
made in Andalusia, Portugal, and Extremadura.
It is still produced at Andujar and elsewhere.
Nearly all travellers in Spain describe it, and insist
upon the curious circumstance that it was eaten
by the Spanish women. &ldquo;I have mentioned elsewhere,&rdquo;
wrote Countess d'Aulnoy, &ldquo;the longing
many women feel to chew this clay, which often
obstructs their bodies internally. Their stomachs
swell, and grow as hard as stone, while their
skin turns yellow as a quince. I also felt a
curiosity to taste this ware, that is so highly yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
so undeservedly esteemed; but I would devour a
grindstone rather than put it in my mouth again.
Nevertheless, if one wants to be agreeable to the
Spanish ladies, one has to present them with some
<i>bucaros</i>, which they themselves call <i>barros</i>, and
which, as many deem, possess such numerous and
admirable qualities, since they claim for the clay
that it cures sickness, and that a drinking vessel
made of it betrays the presence of a poison. I
possess one which spoils the taste of wine, but
greatly improves water. This liquid seems to
boil and tremble when it is thrown into the cup in
question; but after a little while the vessel
empties&mdash;so porous is the clay of which it is
composed&mdash;and then it has a fragrant odour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similar accounts are given by travellers of a
later time. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; wrote Swinburne, &ldquo;I could
contrive a method of carrying you some of the
fine earthen jars, called <i>buxaros</i>, which are made
in Andalusia. They are remarkably convenient
for water-drinkers, as they are light, smooth, and
handy; being not more than half-baked, they are
very porous, and the outside is kept moist by the
water's filtering through; though placed in the sun,
the water in the pots remains as cold as ice. The
most disagreeable circumstance attending them is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that they emit a smell of earth refreshed by a
sudden shower after a long drought.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Laborde, who wrote a few years later, seems to
have copied some of his information from Bowles.
&ldquo;The Murcians,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;use in their houses
little jars called <i>Bucaros</i>, the same as those which
in some parts of Andalusia are called Alcarrazas.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
They have handles open at the top, are smaller at
the bottom than above, and bulge in the middle;
they are slight, porous, smooth, and half-baked;
they are made of a peculiar kind of clay. When
water is put into them, they emit a smell like that
sent up by the earth after a shower of rain in
summer. The water makes its way very slowly
through the pores, and keeps them constantly
moist on the outside; they are used to cool water
for drinking. The windows and balconies of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the houses have large iron rings, with a flat surface,
on which they are placed at night, and the water,
oozing incessantly, becomes very cool.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In Andalusia
some of these jars are white, and others red;
in Murcia they have only white ones. They appear
to be in every respect of the same nature as
the evaporating vases of Africa, Egypt, Syria,
and India, of which so much has been said by
travellers, and on which the learned have made so
many dissertations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same vessels are noticed by Ford in his
description of a Spanish <i>posada</i>. &ldquo;Near the staircase
downstairs, and always in a visible place, is
a gibbous jar, <i>tinaja</i>, of the ancient classical
amphora shape, filled with fresh water; and by
it is a tin or copper utensil to take water out with,
and often a row of small pipkins, made of a red
porous clay,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which are kept ready filled with
water, on, or rather in, a shelf fixed to the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and called <i>la tallada, el taller</i>. These pots,
<i>alcarrazas</i>, from the constant evaporation, keep
the water extremely cool. They are of various
shapes, many, especially in Valencia and Andalusia,
being of the unchanged identical form of
those similar clay drinking-vessels discovered at
Pompeii. They are the precise <i>trulla</i>. Martial
speaks both of the colour and the material of
those made at Saguntum, where they still are
prepared in great quantities; they are not unlike
the <i>ckool'lehs</i> of Egypt, which are made of the
same material and for the same purposes, and
represent the ancient Canobic &#954;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;. They are
seldom destined to be placed on the table; their
bottoms being pointed and conical, they could not
stand upright. This singular form was given to
the <i>vasa futilia</i>, or cups used at the sacrifices of
Vesta, which would have been defiled had they
touched the ground. As soon, therefore, as they
are drunk off, they are refilled and replaced in
their holes on the shelf, as is done with decanters
in our butlers' pantries.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>I am only aware of one author who derides the
statement that this porous clay was eaten by the
Spanish women. According to Bowles, who certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
describes and comments on it with intelligence
and scholarship, the neighbourhood of
Andujar contains &ldquo;large quantities of the white
argil of which are made the jars or <i>alcarrazas</i>
which serve in many parts of Spain for cooling
water in the summer-time. In other parts of
Andalusia is found a red variety of this clay, employed
in making the vessels known as <i>búcaros</i>,
which serve to freshen the water as well as for
drinking it out of&mdash;a thing the Spanish ladies
love greatly. Both the white <i>alcarrazas</i> and
the <i>búcaros</i> as red as the blood of a bull are
thin, porous, smooth, and half-baked. When
filled with water they emit a pleasant smell like
that of dry earth rained upon in summer, and as
the water filters through the outer surface, remain
continually damp.&rdquo; The same writer adds that
at that time (1752) the <i>búcaros</i> proceeding from
the Indies were of finer workmanship, and had
a more agreeable smell than those of Spanish
manufacture. &ldquo;In the Encyclopædia,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;and in the Dictionary of Natural History,
we read that Spanish ladies are for ever chewing
<i>búcaro</i>, and that the hardest penance their confessors
can inflict upon them is to deprive them
for a single day of this enjoyment.&rdquo; Bowles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
however, quotes these observations in a scornful
tone, and deprecates the habit of &ldquo;believing writers
who without inquiring into things, concoct and
publish novels to divert the populace and rid them
of their money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning our attention once again to the finer
kinds of Talavera ware, Gestoso adduces proofs
that this as well as Chinese porcelain was faultlessly
and freely imitated in the potteries of Seville.
Here, therefore, is a source of fresh confusion; and
probably a great proportion of the polychrome
ware which goes by the name of Talaveran is
really of Sevillian origin. It is further known that
at one period, which seems to begin with the second
half of the sixteenth century, potters who were
natives of Talavera were hired to work in Seville.</p>

</div>

<p>It has not been ascertained when Talavera herself
grew celebrated for this industry. García
Llansó supposes that at first, before it felt the
influence of Italy and France, her pottery was
partly Mudejar, and vestiges of oriental art survive
in fairly late examples. The characteristic colour-scheme
was either blue on white, or else the
decoration is more variegated. Riaño says:&mdash;&ldquo;Although
we find by the remarks we have quoted
from contemporary authors that earthenware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
every description was made at Talavera, the
specimens which are more generally met with may
be divided into two groups, which are painted on
a white ground, either in blue, or in colours, in the
manner of Italian maiolica. The most important
examples which have reached us consist of bowls
of different sizes, dishes, vases (Plate <a href="#img_198.jpg">lxx</a>.), <i>tinajas</i>,
holy-water vessels, medicine jars, and wall decoration.
Blue oriental china was imitated to a vast
extent: the colouring was successful, but the design
was an imitation of the baroque school of the time,
and the figures, landscapes, and decoration follow
the bad taste so general in Spain in the eighteenth
century. The imitations of Italian maiolica are
effective. The colours most commonly used are
manganese, orange, blue, and green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talavera maintained her reputation for pottery
till nearly the middle of the eighteenth century,
supporting more than six hundred workmen
employed in eight large potteries.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> From then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
onwards the trade declined, and by the close of the
same century was practically dead, owing, Larruga
tells us, to the constantly increasing cost of prime
materials. Nevertheless, the Crown made efforts
to revive the craft, and met with some success till
1777, in which year four establishments (locally
known as <i>barrerías</i>) for making common pottery
were opened in the same town, and speedily
crushed their rivals. &ldquo;The potteries of Talavera,&rdquo;
wrote Laborde soon after this, &ldquo;were greatly
celebrated for many years, and supplied a lucrative
and important branch of commerce. They are
evidently on the decline. The manufactories are
reduced to seven or eight. These productions no
longer exhibit the same delicacy of execution.
Their designs are also lamentably defective. The
material employed in them is a certain earth
which is found near Calera, three leagues from
Talavera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older Talavera ware, decorated, as a rule,
with horses, birds, hunting-scenes, or coats of
arms, is seldom met with nowadays. Although
it is not particularly choice, the drawing is firm,
and the colouring vigorous and agreeable.</p>

<p>I have said that pottery continued to be made
in Aragon, at Muel, Villafeliche, and other places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
In course of time these local industries were also
suffered to decay. Laborde says that early in the
nineteenth century the Villafeliche factory employed
thirty-eight workmen. &ldquo;The ware is of a
very inferior sort. This article might be carried
to a greater extent. In several parts of the
province, earth is found of an excellent quality
for earthenware, particularly in Zaragoza and in
Tauste; the latter affords the best, which is very
fine, and of three colours, and would answer for
the making of porcelain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century Toledo, upon the
initiative of Don Ignacio Velasco, produced good
imitations of Genoese ware, while other kinds of
pottery were made at Teruel, Valladolid, Jaen,
Zamora, Segovia, Puente del Arzobispo, and in
the Balearic Islands. Another region which continued
to be a most important centre of the potter's
craft was Cataluña, where it had always been
encouraged by this thrifty and art-loving people.
As early as the year 1257 two potters occupied
a place upon the municipal council of Barcelona,
while the potters' guild was strictly regulated from
the beginning of the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
same time two whole streets in the centre of the
town, as well as others in the suburbs, were
occupied by potters. The ancient names of these
streets are yet retained in the Calles Escudillers,
Escudillers Blancs (white varnished pottery),
Obradors (where many of the potteries were
situated), and Tallers (<i>i.e.</i> the potteries for producing
common ware).</p>

<p>The pottery of Cataluña generally was largely
exported to Sicily, Alexandria, and other parts.
Among the places in this region which produced
it were Tarragona, Tortosa, and Villafranca. In
1528 the municipal council of the capital herself
forbade, as a protective measure, the introduction
into Barcelona of local pottery made at Malgrat,
La Selva, and other towns and villages of this
neighbourhood. In 1546 the Portuguese Barreyros
declared in his work <i>Chorografía de algunos
lugares</i> that the Barcelona ware surpassed all
other classes made in Spain, including the Valencian.
She continued to produce good pottery all
through the sixteenth century, and excellent common
ware until considerably later.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>About the beginning of the eighteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Laborde mentioned as working centres of this
craft &ldquo;manufactories of delf-ware at Avilés, Gijón,
Oviedo, Nava, and Cangas de Onis, in the Asturias;
at Segovia in Old Castile; at Puente del Arzobispo
and Talavera de la Reina in New Castile; at
Seville in the kingdom of that name; at Villafeliche
in Aragon; at Onda, Alcora, and Manises, in the
kingdom of Valencia; at San Andero in Biscay;
and at Tortosa in Cataluña&hellip;. The most
important of these potteries is the one at Alcora,
the delf of which is tolerably fine, though not of
the first quality. No china is made, except at
Alcora and Madrid: that of the former place is
very common, and inconsiderable as to quantity.
The china manufactured at Madrid is beautiful,
and without exaggeration may be considered as
equalling that of Sèvres. It is a royal pottery;
but it is impossible to give any description of its
state, because admission to the interior of the
manufactory is strictly prohibited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ricord states in his pamphlet relative to
Valencian industries that in 1791 factories of
high-class pottery were working in the kingdom
of Valencia, at Onda, Alcora, Ribesalves, Manises,
Eslida, and Bechí; and of common ware at San
Felipe, Morella, Manises, Murviedro, Alicante,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Moncada, Orihuela, Segorbe, and other towns
and villages of this locality. In all, there were
throughout the province eighty-seven of these
latter potteries, besides two hundred and twenty
tileries, and four factories of artistic tiles or
<i>azulejos</i> established at Valencia. The yearly
output of these <i>azulejerias</i> was 150,000 tiles,
20,000 of which were exported to Andalusia and
Castile.</p>

<p>Although the pottery of Alcora only achieved
distinction at a later age, this craft had long been
practised in the neighbourhood. This circumstance
induced the Count of Aranda to found
here, in 1726, a large factory for producing costly
and artistic ware. Riaño obtained permission
to examine the archives of the family of Aranda,
with their mass of documents relating to this
enterprise. His notice of Alcora ware is therefore
most complete and valuable, and has been
copied, frequently without acknowledgment, by
almost every writer on the subject.</p>

<p>It appears from these archives that the cost
of building and opening the factory of Alcora
amounted to about £10,000. The works were
placed beneath the supervision of Don Joaquín
Joseph de Sayas, at the same time that a Frenchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
named Ollery was engaged at a good salary
and brought from Moustiers to act as principal
draughtsman. A couple of years later Count
Aranda paid Ollery the high compliment of saying
that &ldquo;the fine and numerous models which he
has designed, have contributed to make my manufacture
the first in Spain.&rdquo; He seems to have
retired in 1737, when the Count rewarded him
with a yearly pension of five hundred francs
besides the amount of his salary, &ldquo;for his especial
zeal in the improvement of the manufactory, and
his great skill in directing the construction of every
kind of work.&rdquo; Riaño adds that from this date
until the manufacture of porcelain in 1764, only
Spanish artists worked at Alcora.</p>

<p>The products of this factory continued to
improve, and reached, in course of time, a yearly
total of about three hundred thousand objects.
The ordinances, which are dated between 1732
and 1733, tell us that &ldquo;in these works of ours no
pottery should be made except the very finest,
similar to the Chinese, and of as fine an earth.
The models and wheels should be perfect, the
drawing first-rate, the varnish and colours excellent,
and the pottery light and of the highest
quality, for it is our express wish that the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
pottery should only be distinguished from that of
an inferior kind by the greater or less amount of
painting which covers it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not less interesting are certain communications,
copied by Riaño, which passed in 1746 between
the Spanish Tribunal of Commerce and
the Count of Aranda, in which it is stated that
&ldquo;the perfection of the earthenware of Alcora
consists in the excellent models which have been
made by competent foreign artists, as well as in
the quality of the earth and the recipes brought
at great cost from abroad.&rdquo; We learn from the
same document that &ldquo;from the earliest period of
the manufacture, pyramids with figures of children,
holding garlands of flowers and baskets of fruits
on their heads, were made with great perfection;
also brackets, centre and three-cornered tables,
large objects, some as large as five feet high, to
be placed upon them, chandeliers, cornucopias,
statues of different kinds, and animals of different
sorts and sizes. The entire ornamentation of a
room has also been made here; the work is so
perfect that nothing in Spain, France, Italy, or
Holland could equal it in merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not necessary to follow in close detail
all the modifications and vicissitudes (extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
over quite a hundred years) which affected the
Alcora factory. I therefore only take some
general notices from Riaño. In 1750 Count
Aranda transferred the works to a private company,
which remained in possession of them until
1766. In 1741 a Frenchman named François
Haly was engaged for ten years, and with a
yearly salary of rather more than a thousand
francs, under the following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the travelling expenses of his wife and
children should be given him, and that his salary
should be paid as soon as he made before the
Director and two competent judges the different
kinds of porcelain which he had undertaken to
make.&rdquo; Haly agreed to surrender his recipes,
and it was promised him that he should have two
modellers and one painter working by his side,
and that if in one year his porcelain were satisfactory,
the Count would make him a present of a
thousand <i>tornoises</i>.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Porcelain was first produced at Alcora towards
the middle of the eighteenth century. A contract
was drawn up on March 24th, 1764, with
a German called John Christian Knipfer, who
had already worked there in the pottery section.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
By the original agreement, which exists in the
archives, we find he was to prepare works of
&ldquo;porcelain and painting similar to those made at
Dresden, during a period of six years, under the
following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the said Knipfer obliges himself to
make and teach the apprentices the composition
and perfection of porcelain paste, its varnishes,
and colours, and whatever he may know at the
present time, or discover during this period of six
years; he is not to prevent the Director of the
Works from being present at all the essays made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The said Knipfer offers to make and varnish
porcelain, and to employ gold and silver in its
decoration, and in that of the ordinary wares;
likewise the colours of crimson, purple, violet,
blues of different shades, yellow, greens, browns,
reds, and black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Knipfer will give up an account of his
secrets, and the management and manner of using
them, in order that in all times the truth of what
he has asserted may be verified.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>In 1774 a Frenchman named François Martin
was engaged to make &ldquo;hard paste porcelain,
Japanese faïence, English paste (pipeclay), and likewise
to mould and bake it: the necessary materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to be provided by the Count of Aranda.&rdquo; Riaño
says that the combined assistance of Knipfer and
Martin went far to better the products of the factory.</p>

<p>Martin died in 1786, and Knipfer left soon afterwards.
A Frenchman was now engaged, whose
services proved also beneficial to the works.
This was Pierre Cloostermans, &ldquo;a skilful man,
well versed in the manufacture of porcelain pastes,
as well as in painting and decorating them.&rdquo;
Cloostermans, however, was much molested by
the envy of the Spanish workmen at Alcora, as
well as by their typical intolerance in matters of
religion, although the Count, his master, behaved
towards him with the utmost kindness. Under
his supervision, the quality of Alcora ware was
notably improved. Figures and groups of many
kinds were attempted, and even Wedgwood jasper
ware was creditably imitated. In 1789, among
other pottery that was sent to Madrid were &ldquo;two
hard paste porcelain cups, adorned with low relief
in the English style.&rdquo; The most important one
was moulded by Francisco Garcés, the garlands
and low reliefs by Joaquín Ferrer, sculptor, the
flowers on the covers by an apprentice, helped
by Cloostermans.</p>

<p>Dated in the same year (1789), Riaño quotes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
interesting letter from the Count of Aranda to Don
Pedro Abadia, his steward. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;to export the porcelain of my manufactory, but
chiefly in common objects, such as cups of different
kinds, tea and coffee services, etc. These may be
varied in form and colour, the principal point being
that the paste should bear hot liquids, for we
Spaniards above everything wish that nothing we
buy should ever break. By no means let time be
wasted in making anything that requires much
loss of time. The chief object is that the pastes
should be of first-rate excellence and durability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1793 Cloostermans was driven from the
country by political disturbances; but he was
allowed to return in 1795, and resumed his duties
at the factory. All through these years Alcora
continued to make most excellent pottery. Essays
were made with foreign earths, as well as with the
best that could be found in Spain. About this
time kaolin was discovered in Cataluña, and the
Count was particularly anxious that this native
product should be utilised at Alcora. &ldquo;The
kaolin of Cataluña,&rdquo; he wrote in 1790, &ldquo;may be
good or bad, but it is acknowledged to be kaolin,
and if we do not employ it I must close my works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Count of Aranda and Pierre Cloostermans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
both died in 1798, and in 1800 the Duke of Hijar
became the manager and proprietor of the potteries.
&ldquo;Two hundred workmen were employed, and
pottery of every description was made, common
earthenware, pipeclays in imitation of the English
ones, and porcelain in small quantities; common
wares were made in large quantities; the pipeclays
were pronounced superior to the English in
brilliancy, but were so porous that they were easily
stained. A large number of snuff-boxes and other
small objects belong to this period.&rdquo;&mdash;(Riaño.)</p>

<p>In the early years of the nineteenth century
Alcora ware deteriorated not a little. This decline
was further aggravated by the French invasion;
and although an attempt was subsequently made
to revive the industry by bringing craftsmen from
the porcelain factory of Madrid, it suffered fresh
relapses and produced henceforward little but the
commonest kinds of ware. &ldquo;This system,&rdquo; says
Riaño, &ldquo;continued until 1858, when the Duke
of Hijar sold the manufactory to Don Ramón
Girona, who brought over English workmen from
Staffordshire in order to improve the wares.
Many imitations of the older styles have also been
made at Alcora of late years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riaño appends instructive tables, which I copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
in Appendix I, of every kind of pottery manufactured
at Alcora. He also believes that a great
deal of pottery which was formerly thought to
proceed from French or English factories is really
of Alcora make, including &ldquo;a great quantity of
objects of white pipeclay porcelain which have
been found of late years in Spain. They have
hitherto been classified by amateurs as Leeds
pottery. We find, in papers relating to Alcora,
that a decided distinction is made between white
and straw-coloured pottery. This indication may
be sufficient to distinguish it from English wares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The celebrated Royal Porcelain Factory of the
Buen Retiro at Madrid, formerly situated in the
public gardens of that name and popularly known
as the &ldquo;Fabrica de la China,&rdquo; was founded in
1759 by Charles the Third, who erected a vast
edifice for this purpose, and filled it with a multitude
of workmen and their families, including two
hundred and twenty-five persons whom he brought
over from his other factory of Capo-di-Monte in
Italy. He also transferred a great part of the
material.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The cost of the new works amounted
to eleven and a half millions of <i>reales</i>, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
were terminated in 1764. The cost of keeping
up the factory is stated by Larruga to have
amounted to three millions of <i>reales</i> yearly. The
first directors were Juan Tomás Bonicelli and
Domingo Bonicelli, and the first modellers-in-chief
and superintendents, possessing the secrets
of the fabrication (<i>secretistas</i>), were Cayetano
Schepers and Carlos Gricci.</p>

<p>Riaño says that every kind of porcelain was made
at the Buen Retiro, &ldquo;hard and soft paste, white
china, glazed or unglazed, or painted and modelled
in the style of Capo-di-Monte.&rdquo; A great many
objects existed imitating the blue jasper ware of
Wedgwood, and they also made flowers, coloured
and biscuit, groups (Pl. <a href="#img_208.jpg">lxxi</a>.), and single figures,
and painted porcelain of different kinds. Great
quantities of tiles for pavements were also made
there, which may still be seen at the Casa del
Labrador at Aranjuez: they are mentioned in the
accounts which exist at the Ministry of Finance for
1807 and 1808. We find in these same accounts
interesting details of the objects made monthly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
In January, 1808, a large number of figures were
made, including 151 heads for the table centre
which was made for the king, 306 objects ornamented
with paintings, 2506 tiles, 577 objects of
less artistic importance, such as dishes, plates,
etc. The finest specimens which exist are in the
Neapolitan style, and are two rooms at the palaces
of Madrid and Aranjuez, of which the walls are
completely covered with China plaques and looking-glasses,
modelled in the most admirable manner
with figures, fruits, and flowers. The room at
Aranjuez is covered with a bold ornamentation of
figures in the Japanese style, in high relief, painted
with colours and gold with the most exquisite
details. The figures unite the fine Italian modelling
with the Japanese decoration. The chandelier
is in the same style (Plate <a href="#img_214.jpg">lxxii</a>.). Upon a vase
on the wainscot to the right of the entrance door
is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>The earliest mark upon the Buen Retiro porcelain
was a blue fleur-de-lis, to which were subsequently
added the letter M and a royal crown. Still later,
in the reign of Charles the Fourth, the mark used
was a fleur-de-lis with two crossed C's.</p>

<p>The object of the Buen Retiro Factory was
almost wholly to supply the Crown with costly
ware, and would-be visitors were jealously excluded.
Townsend wrote in 1786: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&ldquo;I tried to
obtain admission to the china manufacture, which
is likewise administered on the king's account, but
his Majesty's injunctions are so severe, that I
could neither get introduced to see it, nor meet
with anyone who had ever been able to procure
that favour for himself. I was the less mortified
upon this occasion, because from the specimens
which I have seen, both in the palace at Madrid
and in the provinces, it resembles the manufacture
of Sèvres, which I had formerly visited in a tour
through France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laborde also complained that the factory was
&ldquo;wholly inaccessible: all entrance to it is interdicted,
and its existence is only ascertained by
the exhibition which is made of its productions
in the royal palace.&rdquo; The same writer refers to
another class of work which was produced here,
namely, stone mosaic. &ldquo;The process by which
stone is wrought into pictures is as delicate
as it is curious: a selection is made from marble
fragments of various shades and dimensions,
which are found, by judicious assimilation, to
produce no bad resemblance to painting.&rdquo; Jean
François de Bourgoing, French Minister at
Madrid, was lucky enough, in 1782, to penetrate
into the factory and view the process. &ldquo;Le
Monarque actuel,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;a établi dans leur
intérieur une fabrique de porcelaine, dont l'entrée
est jusqu'à présent interdite à tout le monde.
On veut sans doute que ses essais se perfectionnent
dans le silence, avant de les exposer aux
regards des curieux. Ses productions ne peuvent
encore se voir que dans les Palais du Souverain,
ou dans quelques Cours d'Italie, auxquelles il
les envoie en présens. On travaille dans le même
édifice à certains ouvrages de marqueterie, qui
sont encore peu connus en Europe. J'y pénétrai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
un jour, sous les auspices d'un étranger distingué
en faveur duquel le Roi avoit levé la prohibition
rigoureuse, qui en exclut tout le monde. Je suis
témoin de la patience and de l'adresse avec
lesquelles on taille and on rapproche divers petits
morceaux de marbre coloré, pour en former des
tableaux assez compliqués, qui en faisant à-peu-près
le même effet que la peinture, ont sur elle
l'avantage de braver par leur couleur immortelles
les ravages du temps, qui n'épargnent pas les
plus belles productions de cet art.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>This factory was not long-lived. Until 1803
it followed the styles of the older establishment at
Capo-di-Monte, uniting neo-classic motives with
the manner of Baroque. In that year it began
to produce porcelain imitating that of Sèvres,
and two Frenchmen, Vivien and Victor Perche,
were brought from Paris to superintend this
change. &ldquo;Among the finest specimens of this
period,&rdquo; says Riaño, &ldquo;are a splendid clock and
four vases, two mètres high, with porcelain flowers,
which exist in one of the state rooms of the Palace
of Madrid. The vases are placed in the four
corners of the room. The clock is ornamented
with large biscuit figures. A large number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
vases of Retiro china exist at the royal palaces of
Madrid, Aranjuez, and the Escorial. They are
often finely mounted in gilt bronze with muslin or
porcelain flowers. The blue of the imitations of
Wedgwood is not so pure, nor is the biscuit work
so fine as the English. Gold is often added to
these specimens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this manufacture was by now
decadent. It had suffered severely from the death
of Charles the Third, and upon the French invasion
in 1808 was seized by the enemy and occupied
by them for several months. During the
reign of the &ldquo;<i>intruso</i>,&rdquo; Joseph Buonaparte, porcelain
was still produced to some extent; but by the
time of the Peninsular campaign the works had
practically ceased. &ldquo;Near this quarter,&rdquo; wrote
Ford, describing the Retiro gardens, towards the
middle of last century, &ldquo;was <i>La China</i>, or the royal
porcelain manufactory, that was destroyed by the
invaders, and made by them into a fortification,
which surrendered, with two hundred cannon,
August 14th, 1812, to the Duke. It was blown
up October 30th, by Lord Hill, when the misconduct
of Ballesteros compelled him to evacuate
Madrid. Now <i>La China</i> is one of the standing
Spanish and <i>afrancesado</i> calumnies against us, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
it is stated that we, the English, destroyed this
manufactory from commercial jealousy, because it
was a rival to our potteries. &lsquo;What can be done
(as the Duke said) with such libels but despise
them. There is no end of the calumnies against
me and the army, and I should have no time to do
anything else if I were to begin either to refute
or even to notice them?&rsquo; (Disp., Oct. 16, 1813.)
These china potsherds and similar inventions of
the enemy shivered against his iron power of
conscious superiority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real plain <i>truth</i> is this. The French
broke the <i>ollas</i>, and converted this Sèvres of
Madrid into a Bastile, which, and not the pipkins,
was destroyed by the English, who now, so far
from dreading any Spanish competition, have
actually introduced their system of pottery; and
accordingly very fair china is now made at Madrid
and Seville, and by English workmen. At the
latter place a convent, also converted by Soult
into a citadel, is now made a hardware manufactory
by our countryman, Mr Pickman. Ferdinand
the Seventh, on his restoration, re-created
<i>La China</i>, removing the workshops and warerooms
to La Moncloa, once a villa of the Alva family
on the Manzanares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This factory of La Moncloa was founded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
1816, and it continued working until 1849. A
specimen of the Moncloa ware is reproduced in
Plate <a href="#img_218.jpg">lxxiii</a>.</p>

<p>Outside the royal palaces of Spain, the Buen
Retiro porcelain is scarce. The choicest collections
which are not the property of the Crown
belong, or have belonged till recently, to the
Marquis of Arcicollar, the Count of Valencia de
Don Juan, and Don Francisco Laiglesia.</p>

Roman ware, and by others Samian, distinguished by its close grain
composed of a fine clay, and presenting, when broken, edges of an
opaque light red colour, whilst the inner and outer surfaces are quite
smooth, and of a brighter and darker red, is found in all places of
the ancient world to which the Roman arms or civilisation reached.
It is distinguished from the Aretine by its darker tone, stronger
glaze, and coarser ornamentation. Possibly, the whole passage of
Pliny in which he speaks of the earthenware of his day refers to this
red ware. Thus, for dishes he praises the Samian and the Aretine
ware; for cups, that of Surrentum, Asta and Pollentia, Saguntum and
Pergamus. Tralles and Mutina had their manufactories. Cos was
most esteemed; Hadria produced the hardest ware. That one of
these, that of Saguntum, was a red ware, is clear; that of Cumæ
was also of the same colour&hellip;. That the red ware is found
amidst the dense forests of Germany and on the distant shores of
Britain, is a remarkable fact in the civilisation of the old world.
It was apparently an importation, being exactly identical wherever
discovered, and is readily distinguished from the local pottery.&rdquo;&mdash;Birch,

fifteen inches high by ten wide, and is decorated with a representation,
in bas-relief, of the Coronation of the Virgin. The eyebrows,
eyelids, and lips of the figures are executed in cobalt upon a thick
layer of white glaze, and strongly recall the method of Lucca della
Robbia. Gestoso considers that this plaque was made in the latter
part of the fourteenth century. If so, it is antecedent to the work
of della Robbia (whose <i>Resurrection</i> upon one of the doors of the
Duomo of Florence dates from 1438) by a good many years. A

Mayor's Chapel at Bristol, whither they were doubtless conveyed by
one of the numerous English merchants who traded between Spain

<h2><a name="GLASS" id="GLASS">GLASS</a></h2>

<p>Small vessels of uncoloured glass, belonging to
the Celtic period, have been discovered in Galicia;
so that the origin of this industry in Spain is
possibly pre-Roman. After the conquest glass
was made here by the Romans,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> who built their
ovens with a celebrated argil (potter's earth) extracted
from the neighbourhood of Valencia or
Tortosa. The Roman glass was doubtless imitated
by the native Spaniards: at least we know
from observations by Saint Isidore that this substance
was quite familiar to the Visigoths. &ldquo;Olim
fiebat et in Italia, et per Gallias, et Hispaniam
arena alba mollissima pila mola qua terebatur.&rdquo;
The same author speaks with admiration of coloured
glass-work imitating precious stones. &ldquo;Tingitur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
etiam multis modis, ita ut hyacinthos, saphirosque
et virides imitetur et oniches vel aliarum gemmarum
colores&rdquo;; and again; &ldquo;Fingunt enim eas
ex diverso genere nigro, candido, minioque colore.
Nam pro lapide pretiosissimo smaragdo quidam
vitrum arte inficiunt, et fallit oculos sub dolo quadam
falsa irriditas quoadusque non est qui probet simulatum
et arguat: sic et alia alio atque alio modo.
Neque enim est sine fraude ulla vita mortalium.&rdquo;
We gather from these statements that coloured
glass in imitation of the genuine precious stone
was freely manufactured by the Visigoths. Such
imitations, justifying by their excellence Saint
Isidore's assertion that &ldquo;vera a falsis discernere
magna difficultas est,&rdquo; may still be seen upon
the crowns and other ornaments discovered at
Guarrazar (see Vol. I., pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44391/44391-h/44391-h.htm#Page_15">15&ndash;29</a>), as well as upon
triptyches and weapons. Indeed, a taste for imitation
jewels forms an inherent trait of Spanish
character, and is discoverable at all moments of
the national history. Travellers have constantly
observed it, and the remarks, already quoted, of
Countess d'Aulnoy, are confirmed by other authors.
&ldquo;In the broken banks south of the river,&rdquo; wrote
Swinburne of the Manzanares at Madrid, &ldquo;are
found large quantities of pebbles, called Diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of Saint Isidro. They cut them like precious
stones, and ladies of the first fashion wear them
in their hair as pins, or on their fingers as rings.
They have little or no lustre, and a very dead
glassy water. The value of the best rough stone
does not exceed a few pence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is chiefly in the form of imitation gems that
specimens of the earliest Spanish glass have been
preserved until our time,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> although the characteristic
of old Roman glass which is known in
Italian as the <i>lattocinio</i> or &ldquo;milk-white&rdquo; ornament,
in the form of a thread or line carried all over
the surface of a vessel, remains until this day
a common feature of the glass of Spain, besides
being found in Spanish-Moorish glass-work.</p>

<p>Rico y Sinobas says that the rules for cutting
glass by means of a diamond or <i>naife</i> (as it was
once called) are embodied in a treatise titled
<i>El Lapidario</i>, originally written (perhaps in the
fourth, fifth, or sixth century) in Hebrew, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
which was brought to Spain some two or three
hundred years later. This treatise was translated
into Arabic by one Abolais, who lived at some
time previous to the thirteenth century, and subsequently
(in the year 1248, and by command of
Alfonso the Learned) into the Castilian language.</p>

<p>Mixed up with a great deal of fabulous and
fantastic matter, this treatise contains instructive
and interesting notices of the composition and the
colouring of old glass, including that of Spain.
One of such notices is the following. &ldquo;Of the
eleventh degree of the sign of Sagittarius is the
glass stone, containing a substance which is a
body in itself (sand), and another which is added
to it (salt), and when they clean these substances
and draw them from the fire, they make between
the two a single body. The stone thus made
(glass) has many colours. Sometimes it is white
(and this is nobler and better than the others), or
sometimes it is red, or green, or <i>xade</i> (a dark,
burnt colour), or purple. It is a stone which
readily melteth in the fire, but which, when drawn
therefrom, turneth again to its former substance:
and if it be drawn from the flame unseasonably,
and without cooling it little by little, it snappeth
asunder. And it receiveth readily whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
colour be placed upon it. And if an animal be
hurt therewith, it openeth as keen a wound as
though it were of iron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The treatise also describes a stone called <i>ecce</i>,
which was used in glassmaking, saying that it was
found in Spain, &ldquo;in a mountain, not of great
height, which overlooks the town of Arraca, and
is called Secludes. And the stone is of an intense
black colour, spotted with yellow drops.
It is shiny and porous, brittle, and of light
weight &hellip;; and if it be ground up with honey,
and the glass be smeared with it and submitted
to the fire, it dyes the glass of a beautiful gold
colour, and makes it stronger than it was before,
so that it does not melt so readily, or snap
asunder with such ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have said that the power of a diamond to cut
glass is referred to in the same work, which
further tells us that this gem &ldquo;breaketh all other
kind of stones, boring holes in them or cutting
them, and no other stone is able to bruise it; nay
more, it powdereth all other stones if it be rubbed
upon them &hellip;; and such as seek to cut or
perforate those other stones take portions of a
diamond, small and slender and sharp-pointed,
and mount them on slips of silver or of copper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and with them make the holes or cuttings they
require. Thus do they grave and carve
intaglios.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All these branches of glassmaking were therefore
practised by the Spaniards from an early
period of their history. This people were also
familiar with the use of emery powder, of talc
applied to covering windows, and of rock crystal.
We read in the translation of Abolais that crystal
at that time was &ldquo;found in many parts, albeit the
finest is that of Ethiopia. The substance
which composes it is frozen water, petrified.
And the proof of this is that when it is broken,
small grains are discovered to be within, that
made their entry as it was becoming stone
(crystallizing); or again, in some of it is found
what seems to be clear water. And it possesses
two qualities in which it is distinct from every
other stone: for when crystal is heated it receiveth
any colouring that is applied to it, and is wrought
with greater ease, besides being melted by fire;
insomuch that it can be made into any shape
desired; and if this shape be round, and the stone
be set in the sun, it burneth anything inflammable
that be set before it: yet does it not effect this by
any virtue of its own, but by <i>the clearness of its</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<i>substance</i>, and by the sunbeams which beat upon
it, and by the roundness of its form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We seem to foreshadow here, clearly enough,
the application of this substance to making glasses
to assist the sight, especially when the author of
the treatise adds that on looking through the
crystal, the human eye discovers &ldquo;details of the
greatest beauty, and things that are secreted from
the simple (<i>i.e.</i> the unaided) vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rico y Sinobas (who possessed a fine collection
of antique glass, Spanish and non-Spanish) inclined
to think that in the time of the Romans the
finest and strongest glass, as well as the costliest
and the most sought after, was that which was
manufactured in Spain. In early times the chief
centres of Spanish glass-making were situated in
the heart of the Peninsula (where now is New
Castile), in the neighbourhood of Tortosa, and in
certain districts lying between the Pyrenees and
the coast of Cataluña, though subsequently the
practice of this craft extended through the
kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia, and the
valleys of Ollería, Salinas, Busot, and the Rio
Almanzora, forming a zone which reached from
Cape Creus to Cape Gata. Other regions in
which the craft was introduced, apparently at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
later epoch, were those of the Mediterranean
littoral, Cuenca, Toledo, Avila, Segovia, and
other parts of New Castile, as far as the slopes
of the Sierra de Guadarrama. In the rest of the
Peninsula there is not the slightest indication
(excepting an obscure reference by Strabo, to
vessels and receptacles of <i>wax</i>) that glass was
made during the Roman domination of the country,
either in Andalusia, Lusitania (Portugal), or in
the northern regions of Cantabria.</p>

<p>Rico y Sinobas has described a Spanish glass-oven
of those primitive times. He says that such
as were used for making objects of a fair size
consisted of three compartments resting one upon
the other; the lowest cylindrical, to hold the fire
and ashes, the next with a domed top, for concentrating
the heat, and the third and uppermost,
which also had a domed top, for holding the
pieces of glass that were set to cool by slow
degrees. The wall of the oven contained a
number of openings, which served, according to
the level at which they were situated, for
controlling the fire, adjusting the crucibles, or
extracting, by means of metal rods, the lumps of
molten glass, previously to submitting them to
the action of the blowpipe. The dimensions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
such of these primitive ovens as have been found
in Spain or Italy, are nine feet in height by six
feet in diameter, and the material of which they
are built is argil, of a kind insensible to heat, and
carefully freed by washing from all foreign, soluble,
or inflammable substances. The crucibles, which
were fitted in the oven two, four, or at most six at
a time, were of this argil also, wrought and purified
with even greater care. Ovens and crucibles of
a smaller size were used for making diminutive
objects such as beads and imitation precious
stones.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Almería was probably the most important centre
of Spanish-Moorish glass-making, and is mentioned
in connection with this craft by Al-Makkari.
The oriental shape of the older vessels which
were made in this locality is still preserved in
certain objects such as jars, bowls, flasks, and
<i>aguardiente</i>-bottles, which are still manufactured,
or were so until quite recently, throughout a region
extending from Almería to the slopes of the
Alpujarra. &ldquo;All these objects,&rdquo; says Riaño, &ldquo;are
decorated with a serrated ornamentation of buttons,
trellis-work, and the lines to which I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
alluded, which were placed there after the object
was made, in the Roman style. The paste is
generally of a dark green colour, and when we
find these same features in vessels of clear white
glass, we may affirm that they are contemporary
imitations made at Cadalso or elsewhere, for they
are very seldom to be met with in the provinces
of Almería and Granada, and are generally
found at Toledo and other localities; it is, moreover,
a common condition of oriental art that
its general form complies with a geometrical
tracery, and we never find, as in Italian works
of art, forms and capricious ornamentations which
interfere with the symmetry of the general lines,
and sacrifice them to the beauty of the whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of the original Moorish glass of the
Alhambra has survived till nowadays. Most of it
was destroyed by the explosion, in the year 1590,
of a powder factory which lay immediately beneath
the palace and beside the river Darro. In the
Alhambra archives, particular mention is made
of the circular glass windows or &ldquo;eyes,&rdquo; only
the corresponding holes of which remain, in the
baths of the same palace. This glass, which may
have been in colour, was also destroyed by the explosion,
as were the windows, &ldquo;painted in colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
with fancy devices and Arabic lettering,&rdquo; of the
Sala de Embajadores,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> those of the Hall of the
Two Sisters, and certain windows, &ldquo;painted with
many histories and royal arms,&rdquo; belonging to the
church of the Alhambra.</p>

<p>Excellent glass, reported by some authors to
have equalled that of Venice, was made at
Barcelona from as early as the thirteenth century.
An inventory of the Crown of Aragon, dated A.D.
1389 and quoted by García Llansó, mentions as
manufactured here, glass sweetmeat-vessels, cups,
and silver-mounted tankards blazoned with the
royal arms. The guild of Barcelona glassmakers
was founded in 1455, and later in the same
century Jerónimo Paulo wrote that &ldquo;glass vessels
of varying quality and shape, and which may well
compete with the Venetian, are exported to Rome
and other places.&rdquo; Similar statements are made
by Marineus Siculus and Gaspar Barreyros.</p>

<p>Other centres of Spanish glass-making were
Caspe in Aragon, Seville, Valencia,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Pinar de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Vidriera, Royo Molino (near Jaen,) El Recuenco
(Guadalajara), Cebreros (Avila), Medina del
Campo, Venta del Cojo, Venta de los Toros de
Guisando, and Castiel de la Peña in Castile. The
glass-works of Castiel de la Peña were founded by
the intelligent and indefatigable Hernando de
Zafra, secretary to the Catholic sovereigns,
Ferdinand and Isabella. &ldquo;It has been calculated,&rdquo;
says Riaño, &ldquo;that about two tons of sand
were used at these glass-works every month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More important than the foregoing was the
famous factory of a village in Toledo province
called Cadalso, or sometimes, from the nature
of its only industry, Cadalso (or Cadahalso) de
los Vidrios. The glass made here is mentioned
in terms of high praise by various writers of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, such as
Marineus Siculus and Mendez Silva. The former
of these authors says in his work upon the
<i>Memorable Things of Spain</i>: &ldquo;Glass was produced
in several towns of Castile, the most important
being that of Cadalso, which supplied the whole
kingdom.&rdquo; Ewers and bottles of Cadalso glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
are mentioned in the Alburquerque inventory.
Mendez Silva says that the number of ovens was
originally three, and that their coloured glass
was equal to Venetian (Plate <a href="#img_234.jpg">lxxiv</a>.). This was
towards the middle of the seventeenth century.
Larruga tells us that by the end of the eighteenth
this local industry was languishing. One of the
three ovens had been abandoned. The other two
produced inferior glass, as well as in diminished
quantities.</p>

<p>The glass of Cataluña maintained its ancient
reputation all through the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries and part of the seventeenth, and at
this time was still compared with the Venetian by
observant travellers (Plate <a href="#img_236.jpg">lxxv</a>.). Besides the
capital, the principal glass-works in this province
were at Almatret, Moncada, Cervelló, and Mataró.
In 1489 a Barcelonese, by name Vicente Sala, and
his sons applied to the City Council for leave to
construct an oven at Moncada &ldquo;in order to pursue
the craft of glass-making, <i>lo qual a present aci se
obre axi bellament e suptil com en part del mon</i>
(seeing that the glass we manufacture in this
neighbourhood competes with any in the world
for subtlety and beauty).&rdquo;</p>

<p>A document is extant from which we learn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the City Councillors of Barcelona made strenuous
efforts to prevail upon Ferdinand the Catholic to
abolish a certain monopoly or other form of
exclusive privilege which he had conceded to a
local glass-maker. The result of this appeal is
not recorded. In 1503 Ferdinand presented his
consort with two hundred and seventy-four glass
objects made at Barcelona, and Philip the Second
possessed a hundred and nineteen pieces proceeding
from the same locality.</p>

<p>An important development of this craft was the
manufacture of coloured glass for churches and
cathedrals. In the Peninsula, the earliest introducers
of this branch of glass-making were principally
natives of Germany, France, and Flanders,
who came to Spain at the beginning of the
fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Many of the oldest windows
executed by these foreigners, or by the Spaniards
who were taught by them, are still existing in the
cathedrals of León, Toledo, Burgos, Barcelona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and the Seo of Zaragoza. León has several
windows which date from as far back as the thirteenth
century, and in which the glass is in small
pieces, arranged as though it were mosaic. Some
of the later and larger windows in the same
cathedral are thirty-five feet high, and one, dating
from the sixteenth century, is believed to have
been presented to this temple by Mary of
England, prior to her marriage with Philip the
Second.</p>

<p>It was, however, in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries that the custom became general, in
Spain as in other lands, of colouring the surface
of white glass by partial fusing&mdash;a process which
is mentioned in the treatise of Abolais, to which I
have referred repeatedly. Between the eleventh
and the thirteenth centuries the coloured windows
of Spanish temples were still composed of pieces
of glass united in the manner of mosaic, forming
ornamental patterns of stars and similar devices;
but subsequently to this period the decorative
themes are said to be painted <i>en caballete</i>, and
consist of figures, or the representation of scenes
from Scripture. In Spain, and dating from the
twelfth century, the workshops for preparing this
coloured glass were commonly situated within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
precincts of important temples, such as Toledo
cathedral, or else, as was the case at Burgos, in
separate buildings and <i>dependencias</i>. Here, in
the square ovens characteristic of that age, and
before it was mounted in the ponderous leaden
frame, the glass was coloured with exquisite
solicitude and patience by the hand of the master-craftsman,
sometimes with a colour upon one of
its surfaces alone, sometimes with the same colour
upon both, or sometimes with a different colour
upon either surface. The cartoons from which
such windows were constructed, and which were
often designed by painters of renown, were
usually three in number. The first contained,
upon a reduced scale, a coloured outline of the
window; the second, drawn to the exact scale of
the window as it was to be, was composed of all
the pieces cut out and numbered according to the
various colours; and the third, also of the projected
size of the window, was kept complete, to
serve as a pattern in case the window should
suffer any accident, and require to be restored or
mended. Not one of these cartoons is known to
be preserved to-day, but Rico y Sinobas points out
that from the strong and simple character of their
colouring and outline, the illuminated illustrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of Spanish thirteenth century manuscripts, such
as the <i>Cantigas</i>, and the <i>Book of Chess</i> of Alfonso
the Learned, may well have been utilized for, or
else be copied from, glass windows of that period.</p>

<p>As soon as the cartoon was finished, the
window-painter traced it upon the surface of the
glass. This was in square pieces, fitted conveniently
together, with sufficient space between
the pieces to allow the passage of the leads.
Before being laid upon the glass and being submitted
to the fixing action of fire, the colours were
mixed with honey, urine, vinegar, and other fluids
or substances which served as mediums to attach
the colour to the glass. Thus prepared, and in
the form of powder, the colours were allowed to
dry for two or three days before the glass was
placed in the oven. Yellow, which was the
strongest colour, and that which penetrated
deepest beneath the surface of the glass, was
made from certain combinations of silver and
nitrate of potash, while oxides or other forms of
copper, lead, iron, tin, silver, and manganese, were
used for making black, white, red, green, blue,
purple, violet, or flesh-colour. These colours
penetrated the glass to the depth of about half a
millimetre; but sometimes, after the colour had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
been applied, the craftsman would submit the
glass to friction by a wooden polisher or wheel,
thus giving it an appearance of greater clearness
and transparency at any spot he might
desire.</p>

<p>Among the artists who produced the coloured
windows of León cathedral were Master Joan de
Arge (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1424), Master Baldovín, and Rodrigo
de Ferreras. Those of Toledo date from early
in the fifteenth century, and were made by Albert
of Holland, Vasco Troya, Luis Pedro Francés,
Juan de Campos, and others, including the
eminent Dolfín, who, according to Cean, began to
work here in 1418, by order of the archbishop,
Don Sancho de Rojas. The documents collected
and published for the first time by Zarco del Valle
tell us that on March 22nd, 1424, Dolfín received
from Alfonso Martinez, treasurer and superintendent
of works, two hundred gold florins and
certain other moneys on account of his total
payment of four hundred gold florins for &ldquo;the
eighth window he is making for the head of the
cathedral.&rdquo; Other certificates of payment relating
to Maestre Dolfín (as he always signed himself)
are included in the same collection. By 1427
he was &ldquo;defunct, God pardon him!&rdquo; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
windows he had left unfinished were terminated
by his assistant Lois (Louis).<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>In 1458, and also at Toledo, a friar named
Pablo began to repair the painted windows of the
<i>crucero</i>. His pay was fixed by the &ldquo;abbot and
superintendent of works&rdquo; at fifty <i>maravedis</i> each
day, and that of &ldquo;his lads, Ximeno and Juanico,&rdquo;
at one half of this amount. Other artists engaged
in the same work were Pablo (not the friar just
referred to), Peter, a German, and &ldquo;Master
Henry,&rdquo; who was also German. Pablo received
authority to purchase ten and a half <i>quintales</i> and
thirteen pounds of coloured Flemish glass, at two
thousand <i>maravedis</i> for each <i>quintal</i>. By a contract
dated 1485 (he died between 1487 and 1493),
Master Henry was handed by the cathedral
authorities a sum of 150,000 <i>maravedis</i> &ldquo;to
proceed to Flanders or any other part he may
desire, and where good glass is to be found,
white, blue, green, scarlet, purple, yellow, or
blackish (<i>prieto</i>), equal in thickness to the sample
which he bears, and bring us thence such quantity
as he has need of for the windows of our cathedral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is evident from this notice that Spain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
then unable to produce the finest quality of
glass. With such as he brought with him from
abroad, Henry engaged to fashion &ldquo;every kind
of figure, image, scroll, and other object whatsoever
be commanded him, according to the place
it is to fill; the colours of the glass to be well
mingled and distributed.&rdquo; He was also to make
&ldquo;the leaden casings stout and deep, so as to
embrace and hold the glass aforesaid, that it may
resist the air and wind.&rdquo; In return for this, he
was to be supplied with an erected scaffolding,
with all the chalk and iron he might require, and
with the proper number of assistants, receiving,
in payment of his labour, one hundred and fifteen
<i>maravedis</i> for every square palm of glass the
preparation of which should satisfy the superintendent
and examiners of works.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses to this document was
Henry's wife, María Maldonada, who came forward
to affix her signature &ldquo;with the license and
pleasure of the aforesaid Master Enrique, her
husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1433, Master Juan (perhaps the same as
Joan de Arge, already mentioned) began to work
at the windows of Burgos, where, later in this
century, he was succeeded by Juan de Valdivieso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and Diego de Santillana. We learn from the
<i>Documentos Inéditos</i> (pp. 159, 160) that Santillana
lived at Burgos, and that, on May 31st, 1512, he
contracted to make three &ldquo;historical windows&rdquo;
for the monastery of San Francisco, at a price of
ninety-five <i>maravedis</i> for each palm of glass,
this to be &ldquo;of good colours and shades,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;measured by the Burgos standard.&rdquo; Two other
contracts are preserved, signed by the same
craftsman and both relating to Palencia. By one
of them Santillana is to receive for six &ldquo;storied
windows,&rdquo; the subjects of which are specified,
ninety-five <i>maravedis</i> the palm, besides the
scaffolding and his house and coals.</p>

<p>Arnao de Flandes (Arnold of Flanders) was
appointed master glass-painter to Burgos cathedral
in 1512. Other glass-painters who worked here
in the sixteenth century were Francisco de Valdivieso,
Gaspar Cotin, Juan de Arce, his son Juan
and grandson Pedro, and, in the seventeenth
century, Valentin Ruiz, Francisco Alonso, Simon
Ruiz, and Francisco Alcalde. Most of the
windows made by all these men have been destroyed
by time and weather, and have been
replaced by barren panes of white; but a few fine
specimens of the original work may yet be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in the chapels of the Presentation, the Constable,
and San Jerónimo. Perhaps the most remarkable
of any is the rose-window, above the Puerta del
Sarmental.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Other good cathedral windows prior to the sixteenth
century are those of Avila, which date
from about the year 1497, and were executed by
Diego de Santillana, Juan de Valdivieso, and other
artists; those of the Seo of Zaragoza, by the Catalans
Terri and Jayme Romeu (1447); and some
at Barcelona, painted in 1494 by Gil Fontanet.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the sixteenth century that
Spanish ecclesiastical window-glass attains its
highest grade of excellence.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Dating from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
century are windows in Toledo cathedral, painted
in 1503 by Vasco de Troya, in 1509 by Alejo
Jiménez, in 1513 by Gonzalo de Córdoba (these
are considered by competent judges to be the
finest of any), in 1515 by Juan de la Cuesta, in
1522 by Juan Campos, in 1525 by Albert of
Holland, in 1534 by Juan de Ortega, and in 1542
by Nicolás Vergara the elder.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In 1537 Ortega
was engaged to repair the damaged or broken
panes at a yearly salary of 11,250 <i>maravedis</i>.
Where the panes were wanting, he was to replace
them by new ones painted by his hand, receiving,
for each <i>palmo</i> of new glass so painted, an extra
payment of ninety <i>maravedis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>In the same century the windows of Seville
cathedral, begun some years previously (Cean says
in 1504) by Micer Cristóbal Alemán (&ldquo;Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Christopher the German&rdquo;), were continued by
Masters Jacobo, Juan Juan Vivan, Juan Bernai,
Bernardino de Gelandia, Juan Jaques, Arnold of
Flanders (1525), Arnao de Vergara (1525), Charles
of Bruges, (1557), and Vicente Menandro (1557).<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
In 1562 Diego de Valdivieso, and in 1570 Pedro
de Valdivieso and Gerald of Holland, painted
windows for Cuenca cathedral. In 1542 the
same work was done at Palencia by Diego de
Salcedo, and in 1533 George of Burgundy,
&ldquo;master in the art of glass,&rdquo; then resident at
Burgos, proceeded to the same town and engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to renew the cathedral windows at a cost of a
hundred <i>maravedis</i> for every palm of coloured
glass, and fifty for every palm of plain.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In 1544, sixty-two windows in the nave of
Segovia cathedral were filled with painted glass
prepared chiefly at Valladolid and Medina del
Campo, though some was brought from Flanders.
The remaining windows were left unfilled till
1676, in which year a canon of the cathedral,
named Tomás de la Plaza Aguirre, succeeded in
rediscovering a formula for the practise of this
craft, and the panes yet needed were made and
coloured at Valdequemada by Juan Danis, under
Plaza Aguirre's supervision. Thirty-three additional
windows were completed from this factory.
According to Lecea y García, the chapter of
Segovia cathedral possess, or possessed for many
years, two curious manuscripts relating severally
to <i>The painting of glass windows</i>, by Francisco
Herranz, and <i>Glass-making</i>, by Juan Danis&mdash;the
same who owned and worked the factory at
Valdequemada. These interesting treatises were
examined by Bosarte, who has described them.
He says that the one on glass-making consisted
of twenty-three sheets of clear writing, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
one on glass-painting of eight sheets; both manuscripts
being in quarto size. The latter contained,
distributed beside the text, sketches of
the various instruments required for this craft.
The other and longer monograph consisted of the
following chapters:&mdash;(1) How to draw upon
glass. (2) How to cut glass. (3) How to paint
and shade glass. (4) Of the substances and
ingredients for painting glass. (5) How to give
a flesh-colour to glass. (6) How to give a yellow
or golden colour to white or pale blue glass,
but no other. (7) How to fire glass. (8) How
to make the glass-oven.</p>

<p>Windows were painted in the cathedral of
Palma de Mallorca by Sebastián Danglés in 1566
and by Juan Jordá in 1599, in that of Málaga by
Octavio Valerio in 1579, and in those of Tarragona
and Avila respectively, by Juan Guasch in
1571, and by Pierre de Chiberri in 1549. This
craftsman was undoubtedly a foreigner. The
following entry which concerns him is quoted by
Rosell de Torres from the <i>Libro de Fábrica</i> of
Segovia cathedral: &ldquo;By order of the Canon Juan
Rodriguez, on the twelfth day of August, I paid
to Pierre de Chiberri, master-maker of window-glass,
the sum of 56,560 <i>maravedis</i>, 34,960 for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the casings of seven large windows with their
side-windows&mdash;in all twenty-one casings&mdash;besides
ten casings for the windows of the lower chapels,
containing altogether <span class="smcap">MMMCCCCXCVI</span> palms, amounting
at ten <i>maravedis</i> the palm to the aforesaid
34,960 maravedis: also 19,125 <i>maravedis</i> for
<span class="smcap">CCCLXXII</span> palms of glass for the said chapels at a
<i>real</i> and a half each palm, plus 2476 <i>maravedis</i>
for certain glass which had yet to be measured
because it was in the skylights. The total sum
amounts to the aforesaid 56,560 <i>maravedis</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>During the seventeenth century, glass-work of
various kinds continued to be produced upon a
large scale at Barcelona, Mataró, Gerona, Cuenca,
Toledo, Valmaqueda, and Seville. In 1680 the
Duke of Villahermosa established a glass factory
at San Martin de Valdeiglesias, and placed it
under the direction of a native of Namur named
Diodonet Lambot, aided by various other artists
from the Netherlands. In 1683 Lambot was
succeeded by Santiago Vandoleto, who proved
incompetent, and caused, in 1692, the total stoppage
of the factory.</p>

<p>I have said that glass was made at Medina del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Campo, in the province of Valladolid. Pinheiro
da Veiga's <i>Pincigraphia</i>, written at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, contains an interesting
notice of this glassware. &ldquo;Really, the glass-work
of Valladolid is most beautiful, and worth going
to see if only for the pleasure of its contemplation.
There are objects of considerable size, such as
(glass) pitchers of every form and colour. Others
are called <i>penados</i>, and are of a syphon shape,
pouring out water in small quantities.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Besides
this there are all manner of cunningly contrived
retorts such as we never see in Lisbon, and yet
in Valladolid their cost is only moderate&hellip;.
The principal shops for selling these and porcelain
are two in number, and the prices are the same as
in Portugal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two very important Spanish glass factories
were founded in the eighteenth century. The
first, which was under Crown protection, was
established by Don Juan Goyeneche in the
year 1720 at a place called Nuevo Baztán, in the
province of Toledo. The royal privilege allowed
this factory to produce &ldquo;all articles of glass up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
a height of twenty inches, working and polishing
the same, embellishing, and coating them with
metal; to make looking-glasses and similar ornaments,
glass vessels of all descriptions, white
glass for window-panes, and glass objects of any
kind or shape, whether already known to us, or
that may be invented in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The factory of Nuevo Baztán continued working
for some years, and turned out excellent glass
for exportation to America and other parts; but
it was killed eventually by the rising price of
fuel, and above all by competition from abroad.
&ldquo;When the foreigners,&rdquo; says Larruga in his
<i>Memorias políticas y económicas</i>, &ldquo;saw that the
factory was in full swing, they conspired to bring
about its ruin, and begged their ambassadors to
communicate against it with the ministers; but
finding this of no avail, and recognising the
importance to themselves of overthrowing this
manufacture, they decided to sell glassware at
a price at which it would be impossible to sell
the products of Nuevo Baztán. The amount of
this reduction was the one-third part of the entire
value. By this means the foreigners made it
impossible for the factory to support itself, since
the objects it produced were laid away and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
no purchaser for years. This, and the cost of
the wood required to keep the ovens burning day
and night, not excepting feast-days (for to stop
the fires for a moment would have meant the
spoiling of the oven), induced the downfall of this
celebrated factory, as soon as the fuel of all the
neighbouring forests had been consumed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, upon the closing of these works,
one of the experts who had been employed there,
a Catalan named Ventura Sit, attracted by the
forests of Valsain and the excellent and abundant
sand obtainable in this locality&mdash;principally from
near the villages of Espirdo and Bernuy de
Porreros&mdash;decided to open another glass-works at
La Granja. Here is the royal summer residence
of San Ildefonso, and Sit was fortunate enough to
secure at the outset&mdash;that is, in 1728&mdash;the firm
protection of Philip the Fifth and of his consort,
Isabel Farnese. Instructed by the sovereigns to
make some mirrors, he produced these objects of
a moderate size at first, increasing it, after the
year 1734, to a maximum length of 145 inches by
85 in breadth. Larruga says that these mirrors
were the largest produced anywhere at that time,
and they continued to be made until very nearly
the end of the century. They are often referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to in the narratives of travellers. Swinburne
wrote in 1776: &ldquo;Not far from Carthagena is a
place called Almazaron, where they gather a fine
red earth called Almagra, used in the manufactures
of Saint Ildephonso, for polishing looking-glasses.
In Seville, it is worked up with the tobacco, to
give it a colour, fix its volatility, and communicate
to it that softness which constitutes the
principal merit of Spanish snuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Describing the royal palace at Madrid, the same
author says that the walls of the great audience-chamber
&ldquo;are incrustated with beautiful marble,
and all round hung with large plates of looking-glass
in rich frames. The manufactory of glass is
at Saint Ildefonso, where they cast them of a very
great size; but I am told they are apt to turn out
much rougher and more full of flaws than those
of France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Townsend (1786), &ldquo;The glass
manufacture is here carried to a degree of perfection
unknown in England. The largest mirrors
are made in a brass frame, one hundred and sixty-two
inches long, ninety-three wide, and six deep,
weighing near nine tons. These are designed
wholly for the royal palaces, and for presents from
the king. Yet even for such purposes the factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
is ill-placed, and proves a devouring monster in
a country where provisions are dear, fuel scarce,
and carriage exceedingly expensive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laborde wrote of the same factory a few years
later: &ldquo;There is also a glass-house, in which
bottles are wrought of a superior quality; and white
glasses, which are carved with much ingenuity
(Plates <a href="#img_254.jpg">lxxvi</a>. and <a href="#img_258.jpg">lxxvii</a>.). Near this glass-house
has been founded a manufactory for mirrors, in a
large and well-arranged edifice. There are two
furnaces, and a considerable number of stoves, in
which the plates are left to cool after they have been
precipitated. They are of all dimensions, and the
largest that have yet been fabricated. They are
sometimes from a hundred, a hundred and thirty,
or a hundred and thirty-five inches in height, to
fifty, sixty, or sixty-five inches in breadth: they are
expanded in the hand. The process for polishing
them is performed by a machine;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> they are then
transported to Madrid, for the purpose of being
metallised. It is not uncommon to see tables of
bronze, on which mirrors are extended, a hundred
and sixty inches in length, and ninety in breadth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These tables are described by Bowles: &ldquo;The
largest measures a hundred and forty-five inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in length by eighty-five in breadth, and weighs
four hundred and five <i>arrobas</i>. The smallest
measures a hundred and twenty inches in length,
and seventy-five in breadth, and weighs three
hundred and eighty <i>arrobas</i>.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The best account of any is contained in the
<i>Nouveau Voyage en Espagne</i> (1789) of Bourgoing.
This author wrote: &ldquo;A côté de cette
Fabrique naissante de première nécessité&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
the royal linen factory at La Granja) &ldquo;il y en a
une de luxe qui remonte au regne de Philippe V;
c'est une Manufacture de glaces, la seule qu'il
y ait en Espagne. On s'étoit d'abord borné à
une Verrerie qui subsiste encore, et donne des
bouteilles d'une assez bonne qualité, et des verres
blancs qu'on y cisele avec assez d'adresse. J'en
ai rapporté quelques-uns où l'on a gravé des chiffres,
des lettres, et jusqu'à de jolis paysages. Cette
Verrerie étoit un acheminement à une entreprise
plus brillante. La Manufacture de glaces de
Saint Ildephonse est comparable aux plus beaux
établissements de ce genre; on en peut voir les
dessins dans les Planches de l'Encyclopédie.
L'édifice est vaste et très bien distribué; il contient
deux fourneaux et une vingtaine de fours où l'on
fait refroidir lentement les glaces après les avoir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
coulées. On y en coule dans toutes les dimensions
depuis les carreaux de vitres jusqu'aux plus
grands trumeaux. Elles sont moins blanches
et peut-être moins bien polies que celles de Venise
et de St-Gobin; mais nulle part on n'en a encore
coulé d'aussi grandes. L'opération du coulage s'y
fait avec beaucoup de précision et d'ensemble.
Monseigneur Comte d'Artois eut la curiosité d'y
assister; la glace qu'on y coula devant lui avoit,
autant que je puis m'en souvenir, cent trente-trois
pouces de long, sur soixante-cinq de large, et l'on
m'a assuré qu'il y en avoit encore de plus grandes.
On les dégrossit à mains d'hommes dans une longue
galerie qui est attenante à la Fabrique, et il y a à
un quart de lieue une machine que l'eau fait mouvoir,
et où on acheve de les polir; on les porte
ensuite à Madrid pour les étamer. Le Roi consacre
les plus belles à la parure de ses appartements;
il en fait des cadeaux aux Cours qui ont
des relations intimes avec lui. En 1783, S.M.C. en
fit joindre quelques-unes aux présens qu'il envoyoit
à la Porte Ottomane, avec laquelle elle venoit de
conclure un traité. C'est une idée agréable pour un
cosmopolite tolérant, de penser qu'en dépit des
préjugés de religion et de politique qui divisoient
autrefois les Nations, la main des arts a établi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
entr'elles un échange de jouissances d'un bout de
l'Europe à l'autre, et que les beautés du serrail se
mirent dans les glaces coulées à Saint-Ildefonse,
tandis que les tapis de Turquie sont foulés par des
pieds François. Ce qui sort d'ailleurs de la Manufacture
de Saint-Ildefonse est vendu, pour le
compte du Roi, à Madrid et dans les provinces;
mais on sent bien que ce profit est trop mince
pour couvrir les frais d'un établissement aussi
considérable qui, le bois excepté, est éloigné de
toutes les matières premières qu'il employe, qui est
situé fort avant dans l'intérieur des terres, au sein
des montagnes, et loin de toute rivière navigable;
aussi doit il être compté parmi ces fondations de
luxe qui prosperent à l'ombre du Trône, et qui
ajoutent à son éclat.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>A few more details are added by Swinburne:
&ldquo;Below the town is the manufactory of plate-glass
belonging to the crown, carried on under
the direction of Mr Dowling; two hundred and
eighty men are employed. The largest plate they
have made is one hundred and twenty-six Spanish
inches long; the small pieces are sold in looking-glasses
all over the kingdom; but I am told the
king makes no great profit by it; however, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
a very material point to be able to supply his
subjects with a good commodity, and to keep in
the country a large sum of money that heretofore
went out annually to purchase it from strangers.
They also make bottles and drinking-glasses
(Plates <a href="#img_254.jpg">lxxvi</a>., <a href="#img_258.jpg">lxxvii</a>.); and are now busy erecting
very spacious new furnaces to enlarge the works.
To provide fuel for the fires, they have put the
pinewoods under proper regulations and stated
falls; twenty-seven mule-loads of fir-wood are
consumed every day; and four loads cost the king,
including all the expenses of cutting and bringing
down from the mountains, about forty reals.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">LXXVII<br />GLASS OF THE FACTORY OF SAN ILDEFONSO</p>
</div>

<p>In 1736, the first factory which had been
established at San Ildefonso was nearly destroyed
by fire; but the damage was repaired, and the
factory placed under state control. Its finances
were at no time prosperous. In 1762 Charles the
Third granted a privilege reserving to it the
exclusive sale of glass within a radius of twenty
leagues from Madrid and Segovia; but the sales
did not improve. In spite of this, the monarch,
a few years later, erected a new and costly
factory from designs by Villanueva and Real.
There were two departments in this ample
building. One, for the manufacture of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
plainest glass, was directed by a Hanoverian,
named Sigismund Brun; and the other, devoted
to smaller and more elaborate articles, by Eder, a
Swede. &ldquo;The greater number of the objects
made at these important works were of transparent,
colourless glass, possessing a marked
French style, and were either richly engraved and
cut, or gilded, or sometimes (though less often) they
were made of coloured and enamelled glass. At
this time, too, were manufactured mirrors for the
royal palaces, as well as candlesticks and chandeliers
of great beauty, following the Venetian
method, and embellished with coloured flowers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>In spite of all these efforts, the works at the dawn
of the nineteenth century were in a moribund
condition. In 1829 they passed into the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of private persons, who also failed to make them
pay, and subsequently, owing to the ineptitude of
Spanish governments and the severity of foreign
competition, have definitely closed their doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Catalonia,&rdquo; wrote Laborde, towards the
year 1800, &ldquo;are two glass houses; but the glass
blown in them is dark, and destitute of lustre.
Aragon has four, one at Alfamen, one at Peñalva,
one at Utrillas, and one at Jaulin, which is the
largest; but the quality of the glass is not superior
to that of Catalonia. The glass-house at Utrillas
produces both flint and common glass. Glass
houses are also established at Pajarejo and at
Recuenco in Castile, which manufacture the most
beautifully white and transparent glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1791 there were six glass-ovens in the
kingdom of Valencia, situated at Valencia, Alicante,
Salines, Olleria, and Alcira. They turned
out 2100 pieces in this year, some of which were
exported to Castile and Aragon.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Early in the eighteenth century the glass of
Barcelona was praised by Alvarez de Colmenar
(&ldquo;Il s'y fait de belles verreries&rdquo;), and we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
that all through this period her <i>forns de vidre</i>
continued to produce good work, including holy-water
vessels of uncoloured glass relieved with
blue or with the fine white <i>latticinio</i>, the local
<i>arruixadors</i> or <i>borrachas</i>, and the typical <i>porrón</i>.
The former of these vessels is of small size, and
has several spouts. Commonly it is filled with
scented water for gallants to sprinkle on girls at
dances in the public square. The <i>porrón</i> invariably
excites the curiosity of foreigners,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and is often
thought to be of purely Spanish origin. This is
not so. Upon a Roman lampstand in Naples
museum is a figure of Bacchus riding on a tiger
and &ldquo;holding in his hand the horn from which
the ancients drank, using it as, among some other
peoples, do the modern Catalans&mdash;that is, not
placing the vessel in their mouth, but holding it
aloft and thus imbibing it; a method which
requires no small amount of practice.&rdquo; In fact,
there is reason to believe that the <i>porrón</i> is derived
from a similar vessel in use among the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Persians, who poured their liquor from it into the
hollow of the hand, and thence imbibed it in the
fashion called, in Cataluña and Valencia, <i>al gallet</i>.
For just as a certain class of American displays his
marksmanship in spitting, so does the Catalan
who is accomplished in the art, amuse himself
and others by causing the ruby wine to spout from
his <i>porrón</i> on to the very apex of his nose, continuing
from this point, in the form of a fine and
undulating rivulet, over his upper lip and down his
throat.</p>

<p>Windows of Spanish houses were seldom glazed
until about one hundred years ago. When Bertaut
de Rouen travelled here in 1659, this fact impressed
him disagreeably. Even in the royal palace at
Madrid he found that there were chambers &ldquo;qui
n'ont point du tout de fenestrés, ou qui n'en ont
qu'une petite, et d'où le jour ne vient que d'enhaut,
le verre estant fort rare en Espagne, et la pluspart
des fenestrés des maisons n'ayant pas de vitres.&rdquo;
In 1787, Arthur Young was no less horrified at
the glassless condition of the houses in Cataluña.
&ldquo;Reach Sculló; the inn so bad that our guide
would not permit us to enter it, so he went to the
house of the Curé. A scene followed so new to
English eyes, that we could not refrain from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
laughing very heartily. Not a pane of glass in
the whole town, but our reverend host had a
chimney in his kitchen; he ran to the river to
catch trout; a man brought us some chickens
which were put to death on the spot&hellip;. This
town and its inhabitants are, to the eye, equally
wretched, the smoke-holes instead of chimneys,
the total want of glass windows&mdash;the cheerfulness
of which, to the eye, is known only by the want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, as an exception to this doleful rule,
the town of Poeblar had &ldquo;some good houses with
glass windows, and we saw a well-dressed young
lady gallanted by two monks.&rdquo;</p>

thus taken with a fabric of her own, &ldquo;afferte mihi gladium&rdquo; she
called in Latin to one of her attendants, and, raising the sword,
dashed the offending window into a thousand pieces, crying that in
that spot she would allow no arms but those of her father.</p></div>

León cathedral imitating those of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, remarks that with the sixteenth century the process grew
more complicated, patterns composed with pieces of a single colour
being replaced by glass containing a variety of tints. He has also
discovered the following usage of the older Spanish craftsmen:
&ldquo;By way of furnishing a key to their arrangement, all the pieces
used to be marked with the point of a diamond, and this mark
indicates the tone the glass requires for such and such a part of the
design. The signs most often employed were three, namely X, L,
and V, for red, blue and yellow respectively, intermediate tones being
shown by combinations of these letters&mdash;XL, LV, XV, with &ldquo;lines
of unities&rdquo; placed before or after to indicate the necessary gradation
in the tone.&rdquo;</p></div>

in 1560 the conversion of Saint Paul on a window in the Chapel of
Santiago, in 1567 another window with the scene of the Annunciation,
over the gate of San Miguel, and in 1569 the companion to it,
representing the Visitation, over the Puerta del Bautismo. &ldquo;In all
these windows,&rdquo; wrote Cean, prejudiced, as was customary in his day,
in favour of the strictly classic style, &ldquo;the drawing, pose, and composition
are good, <i>although</i> in the draperies and figures we observe
the influence of Germany.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Cean's own time&mdash;that is, towards the close of the eighteenth
century&mdash;the coloured windows of Seville Cathedral amounted to
ninety-three, five of which were circular, and the rest with the
pointed Gothic arch. The dimensions of the latter are twenty-eight
feet high by twelve feet broad, and the subjects painted on them
include the likenesses of prophets, patriarchs, martyrs, confessors,
and virgins, or scenes from the New Testament, such as the rising
of Lazarus, Christ driving the merchants from the temple, the Last
Supper, and the anointing by Mary Magdalene.</p></div>

p. 53. Rico y Sinobas observes that in the objects produced at the
factory of La Granja, the glass itself is inferior to the engraving or
cutting with which it is adorned. This leads him to infer that the
foreigners brought over by the kings of Spain to superintend the
factory, were cutters and engravers of glass, rather than skilled
glass-makers. He also draws attention to the fact that the Spanish
monarchs chose these foreign craftsmen from too limited a class,
entrusting the most important posts at all the royal factories to
Frenchmen who were stated to descend from the old nobility of
their native country. In this manner the progress and welfare of
the craft itself was sacrificed to an insane prejudice in favour of the
aristocratic origin of the craftsman.</p></div>
